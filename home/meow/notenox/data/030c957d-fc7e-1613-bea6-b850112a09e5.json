  "note": "Talks about the 'virtuous cycle' of coal, iron and steam. From 1200 onwards, the UK had coal available to it. Eventually the invention of chimneys to allow for coal to be used as heat were invented, allowing people to cluster in the city, removing the dependence on hearth stoves and on wood. From there, demand for coal went up.\nNewcomen's engine was used to pump water from coal pits, where the coal pits were becoming deeper as demand grew. The author claims that Newcomen's engine was only economical at the pithead, giving a good reason why steam engines were invented in Britain and nowhere else: because first generation steam engines were only economical when cheap fuel was readily available next to it.\nThe widespread use of coal eventually led to a plentiful and cheap coke, a by-product of coal with fewer impurities that prevented iron from being contaminated when being heated by it. Coke also didn't suffer from compression issues that coal had, so it could be packed more densly, allowing for larger furnaces that could reach the temperatures needed to melt iron (2800F+). This was around the 1750s.\nIron made with coke was still too impure and needed to be refined further. A 'puddling furnace' was created in the 1780s that appied heat while being stirred to help create the wrought iron.",
