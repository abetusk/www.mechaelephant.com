  "note": "Some critiques of UBI, though they seem pretty weak. At one point they talk about how you could eradicate poverty for a fraction of the cost without UBI but the article they link to is talking about using UBI to do that for the 15% or so below the poverty line. It goes on to say that a tax on financial transactions would make them disappear without expanding on how much. This seems more of a strawman argument than anything else. Providing a living wage paycheck to every citizen, regardless of employment or need is what Zamora talks about, without trying to make the better argument that UBI could be applied to a certain stratification of society and could be offset by other social services (healthcare, housing, food stamps, etc.).",
