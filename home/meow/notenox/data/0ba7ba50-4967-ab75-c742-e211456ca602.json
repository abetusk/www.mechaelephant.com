  "note": "Paul Grice introduced the concept of the 'Cooperative Principle' to describe effective conversational communication. The 'Cooperative Principle' can be broken down into four maxims:\n* Quantity - be informative, no more, no less\n* Quality - be truthful\n* Relevance - information should be relevant to current exchange\n* Clarity - present the information in a way that can be understood\nThe idea being that you should have something true of note to say (truth, relevance), say it concisely (quantity) and present it in a format the recipient can understand (clarity).\nI might restate it as [relevant, clear, concise, true]",
