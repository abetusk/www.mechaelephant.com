  "note": "Talks about interactions with Steve Jobs and iTunes. Most relevant to me was a good snapshot of the music landscape at the time, with independent artists being completely forgotten because independent artists couldn't get exposure.\n'Maybe you canâ€™t appreciate this now, but the summer of 2003 was the biggest turning point that independent music has ever had.
