  "note": "Monument valley took about 10 months to develop. From Wikipedia, it looks like there were three developers and two artists. 10 months at 40 hour weeks is (5 ppl * 40 (hrs/week) * 10 months * 4 (weeks/month)) = 8000 ppl hours. Call it 10k hours to develop. The game presumably lasts 1.5 to 2.5 hours, so call it 2hrs. That means (2 play hrs / 10k ppl hrs) = .0002 play hours per people work hours, or (.0002 pphr * 60 (min/hr) * (60 s/min)) = .72 play seconds per 1 people work hour. That is, it takes 1 hour of work for about 1 second of game play.\nFrom Wikipedia again, estimated that it was 26M copies sold, so estimate 1M hours played, that's giving 100 hours of enjoyment per 1 hour developing. Another way to look at it is 1 hour of work generated 100 new people enjoying the game.",
