  "note": "As of July 2021, it looks like nearly 70% of Americans are vaccinated or say they will soon get vaccinated (67% vaccinated, 3% as soon as possible). About 10% are 'wait-and-see', 3% 'only if required' and 14% 'definitely not'. For some context, Dec 2020 had the 'wait and see' crowd at 39%.\n$R_0$ of is estimated to be 2.4-2.6, 4-5 and 5-9 for original, alpha and delta variant respectively. The number of expected infections is $R_0 \\cdot (1 - v \\cdot s)$, where $v$ is the population vaccinated and $s$ is the resistance the vaccination offers. For the original strain, $0.9945 = 2.6 \\cdot (1- 0.64 \\cdot 0.95)$. For the delta variant at $R_0=5$, $0.9625=5\\cdot (1 - 0.85 \\cdot 0.96)$. There's also reason to believe vaccination is less effective against the delta variant, driving the required vaccination percentage up or making it impossible.",
