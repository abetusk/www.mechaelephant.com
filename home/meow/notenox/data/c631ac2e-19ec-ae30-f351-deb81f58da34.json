  "note": "Rise of the 10X class by Dror Poleg. Talks about the economics of superstars, whereby a few players (the 10x) get most of the income and crowd out the mediocre (1x). Rosen: 'Hearing a succession of mediocre singers does not add up to a single outstanding performance'. WSJ/Alan Eustace: '... would rather lose an entire incoming class of engineering graduates than one exceptional technologist'. There's a tension between consolidation of wealth/power and appealing to niche communities and being able to take advantage of long-tailed effects, which the article only touches on and doesn't adequetly resolve (imo).",
