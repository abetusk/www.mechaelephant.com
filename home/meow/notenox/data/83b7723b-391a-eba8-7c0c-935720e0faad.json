  "note": "Dan Luu talks about how corporations tend to see individuals as fungible. Individuals or teams which might be well suited to complete tasks are instead treated as fungible resources to be swapped around on other projects and teams. Corporations could try low risk high reward experiments with small teams working on high impact projects but instead end up in a death spiral of meetings and re-orgs that don't give up the idea that employees are fungible",
