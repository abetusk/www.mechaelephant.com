  "note": "Talks about various texture mapping techniques including triplanar mapping and texture bombing. As far as I can tell, texture bombing basically takes a base texture then samples it multiple times at different angles and points to undo the checkerboard/tiling that occurs. As a simple example, I think taking two textures, one sampled simply and the other one sampled at a non-algebraic rotation and using some blending between them. The rotation ensures aperiodicity. Maybe using just one will still have artifacts, so more might be needed",
