  "note": "Rao talks about culture wars, the various tactics, the battle fronts and some predictions. Some choice quotes:\n> News has a CAP theorem breakdown problem. When producing news-like content becomes cheap enough, people will choose consistency plus availability and give up partition tolerance\n\n> ... in many respects a wartime comparable to WWI in terms of scale of social/institutional change\n\n> The basic reason infowar tactics work at scale is that our brains are wired for evidentiary scarcity ... We seek confirmation .. over disconfirmation ... because that’s rational in info-scarcity environments\n\n> The long tail of new ideological combatants ... From anarcho-capitalist ... crypto warriors to non-neurotypicals ... all busy pseudospeciating adversaries\n\n> If you’re retreating from social media, narrowing info sources to fewer \"trusted\" ones, and breaking up with friends who suddenly seem to have gone crazy, Congrats, you’re a casualty of infowar",
