  "note": "Reaction diffusion reaction explanation from Karl Sims.\nThe idea is to consider two types of particles, A and B, where two Bs combine with an A to form another B. Further, particles will prefer to diffuse out. This leads to two equations for the different particles operating on a grid with the particles considered as concentrations on a grid. The laplacian term is meant to cause diffusion (second derivative positive -> diffuse in (basin, ++), negative -> diffuse out (top of hill, --)). The ABB term is the reaction and the F and K terms of the feed and kill terms for particles A and B respectively.",
