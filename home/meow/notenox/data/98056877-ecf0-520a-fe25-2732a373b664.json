  "note": "Jason Kickel pushes back on Pinker's reduction in global poverty narrative, claiming that, excluding China, poverty increased from 1980 to 2000 which then saw some reduction and has only recently fallen below 1980 levels. I don't know enough to make good critiques of Hickel's point but some things that jump out at me:\n* $7.04, or even $5.04, seems high for a global measure of extreme poverty\n* While $7.40/day might be a better measure of living wage, this is one threshold which doesn't address any idea of some type of progress of wages below that threshold. For example, there might have been a large shift from under $1.90 to $5, say, while a smaller shift from above $7.04 to below which could still be considered a better situation than what just looking at the one $7.04 threshold might imply.\n* discarding all data pre-1981 seems pretty extreme. It might be an imperfect measure but, under some assumptions, it might be more reasonable to accept them with some caveats",
