  "note": "Dirichlet's theorem on arithemetic progressions shows that for any two coprime integers, $a,d$, there are infinitely many primes of the form $a+nd$. A stronger form states that the primes are equially distributed among the classes mod $d$ for $a$ coprime to $d$.\nChebyshev's bias shows that for primes less than a bound, $x$, there is a bias of how primes are distributed mod $d$.",
