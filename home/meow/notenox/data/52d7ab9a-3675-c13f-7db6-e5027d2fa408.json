  "note": "Kleiber's law is an empirical observation that the the basal metabolic rate of an animal tends to scale as 3/4. That is $B \\propto M^{\\frac{3}{4}}$.\nNaively, it's expected to be 2/3 from a surface area to 3d mass argument. It turns out that it's most likely the nutrient dispersion through the circulatory system to the mass.",
