  "note": "Talks about different contexts for receiving information and culture divides. One reaction to a twitter response is 'ugh randos' in that the response is about jockeying for social heirarchy and taking the speaker down a notch to advance one's own social status. Another interpretation is that the response is a reaction to what is perceived as a gift to the commons, with their own response being either another gift to the commons or establishing social repor with the person giving the gift. Whereas someone jockeying for social position would be angry at having their response be corrected, the 'gift to the commons' folks are happy if they are corrected, as it means their gift was received in the spirit it was given and another gift was given in response (correcting them).\nAnother post talks about 'tact filters', where normal folks put a tact filter on what they use to speak and 'nerds' use a tact filter on the receiving side.",
