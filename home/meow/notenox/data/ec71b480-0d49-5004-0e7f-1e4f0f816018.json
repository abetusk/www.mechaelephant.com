  "note": "[Benjamin Reinhardt] talks about creating a DARPA like institution outside of a monopoly or government to do research, which they call PARPA. Some choice observations\n* People who want to do early program work tend to be postdocs, grad students or technically trained people who have left academia\n* 3-5 year yield techonologies that would be hard to fund otherwise\n* $1M expense for a falsifiable experiment on viability in the 1-2 year range",
