  "note": "Bert Hubert talks about the arc of companies losing their ability to innovate by outsourcing more of their core competency. He describes the basic process of having a failure, overlearning a lesson to outsource, demotivating engaged employees by outsourcing the technology they feel passionate about and how shareholders encourage 'zombie companies' because the numbers look good, until the momentum stops and the company fails from lack of innovation. Hubert's suggestion is to be engaged with the politics of the company early to make sure it stays on the right track or, barring that, starting your own. Hubert also recommends a paper: 'Out-Sourcing Pofits' by Hart-Smith from Boeing.",
