  "note": "Plastazone (LD45) low/medium density closed cell foam (2.8 pounds per cubic foot (pcf) density) looks to be a cosplay favorite for led diffusion. \"Wayne's Workshop\" recommends 4-5mm to get enough diffusion for densly packed led strips. Current prices put it at around $30 for a 1mx.5m 6mm sheet",
