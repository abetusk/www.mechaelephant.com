  "note": "Will Prowse has a video on ground mounted solar panels. Some choice tidbits are:\n* He lives in Las Vegas and gets 5-6 hours per day in Summer.\n* He claims with sun tracking, would only get maybe an hour or two more per day (so 20%-30% increased efficiency?) so his claim is it's better to just get more panels\n* He claims his used solar panels operate at about half efficiency\n* He has a 6kW array producing an estimated 30KWh made up of about 18 solar panels (of mixed variety)\n",
