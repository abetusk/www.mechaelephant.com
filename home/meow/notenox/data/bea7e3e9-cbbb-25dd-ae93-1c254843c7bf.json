  "note": "Non fungible tokens (NFTs) are, in my opinion, the beanie babies of the cryptocurrency technology. Beanie babies helped get PayPal off the ground but ultimately didn't have any staying power.\n\nWikipedia talks about how the copyright is often not transferred when purchasing an NFT. OpenSea.io talks about owners of their 'pirate' NFTs can use it for commercial purposes but they still retain the right to use it for their own commercial purposes.",
