  "note": "Talks about the myths of social media. Some key takeways are:\n* There is little misinformation on social media, mostly just exposure to other views, especially from a vocal minority that are politically motivated\n* People aren't more hateful on social media than in real life but the 'hateful few' are more vocal and more visible\n* Social media are not echo chambers. People mostly are connected to others and use it to communicate and organize.",
