  "note": "Ian Cooper gives a talk (2017) at DevTernity talking about 'TDD, Where Dit It All Go Wrong'.\n* Test behaviors not modules. The API or public facing contract is what you should be testing, not the implementation details. The details can change underneath while still providing a consistent API so this is why TDD (as it's implemented) is slow and brittle\n* Recommends reading 'Test-Driven Development' by Kent Beck\n* Unit test refers to the test in isolation, not the method/class underneath",
