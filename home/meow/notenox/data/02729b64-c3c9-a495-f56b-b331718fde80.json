  "note": "Briahna Joy Gray talks about the politics of shame and discusses more effective tactics to bridge the gap to Republicans. Here is a relevant snippet:\n>Nor do I mean to suggest that Trump supporters don’t “deserve” to be shamed; the shaming itself is but meager retribution for the real harms which have resulted from the right’s actions at the ballot box. ... But by unpacking the role shame plays in our political discourse, we can use our words more strategically and become better equipped to move the country in the right (i.e. left) direction.",
