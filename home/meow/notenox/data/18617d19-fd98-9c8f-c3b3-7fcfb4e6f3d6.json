  "note": "Dr Sarah Taber talks on the Community Values podcast about the model for farms. Dr Taber's points: most farms (80%+) are small to mid size. Most food comes from small to mid sized farms (68%). Small to mid sized farms aren't being pushed out by bigger farms, they are the largest share. Farms, though they don't make money, are a pocket for wealth (like an investment property) and farms are not about making food so much as they're about putting land into white hands. That is, the real business model is land speculation. 95% family owned, 90% have supplimental income -> 90% that use farms as side/hobby.",
