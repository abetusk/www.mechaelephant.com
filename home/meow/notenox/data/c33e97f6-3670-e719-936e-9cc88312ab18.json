  "note": "Clara Mattei discusses here book \"The Capital Order: How Economics Invested Austerity and Paved the Way to Fascim\". She argues that there is a trinity of fiscal, monetary and industrial policies that feed into austerity measures to keep workers negotiating rights weak. She argues that after the first world war, it was more apparent to folks coming out of the war that class issues were the primary cause of inequality and, presumably, the cause of the war in some sense. The austerity measures that were promoted by economists of the time would serve as a template for future austerity measuers\\nBy claiming the need to save, social services can be cut weakening social mobility and the ability of common workers to gain political or social power. Keeping unemployment high provides a mechanism to weaken worker bargaining power. By reframing the economy as one in which it's harmonious and \"natural\", the focus shifts from being about class warfare and extolling the virtues of entrepreneurs, not only putting the responsibility on the individual but making the argument \"that prioritizes the saving of the investing elite as the real engine of the economic machine.\"",
