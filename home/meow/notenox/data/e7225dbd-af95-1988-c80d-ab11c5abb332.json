  "note": "France has established a currency for 15 African countries called the CFA franc sicne the end of WWII. This requires 50% reserve currency to be housed in French banks for each of these currencies, with potentially more depending on conditions. This gives undue power over these nations by France, with accusations of the French deposing or killing heads of state that don't agree with the policy. 11 of the 15 nations are classified as 'least developed countries' with the remaining 4 experiencing economic decline. Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria did not use the CFA franc post independence and are economically stronger than the 15 nations that did.",
