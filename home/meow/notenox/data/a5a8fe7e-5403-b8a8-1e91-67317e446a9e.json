  "note": "Some networking gamedev notes.\n- two basic methods, client physics handling with server cheat checks or server side physics with broadcast\n- client side prediction to reduce input latency\n- client side immediate quantities (position, orientation) updates done via 'pos += diff * 0.1;', whereas first derivative quantites (velocity, accel) can be done immediately without noticeable effect\n- client will always be some delta time ahead of server, so keep a short history of moves to rewind and redo on client when necessary",
