  "note": "Timnit Gebru coins the term 'transhuman, extropianism, singularitarianism, cosmism, rationalism, effective altruism, longtermism' and argues that AGI is inherently racist, has eugenic ideals, inherently exploitative, dillusional, takes away from better avenues for resource usage, is and will be used to consolodate power into an elite few who will use it to exploit the general populace, will be used as a tool to further oppress and exploit people in general and is inherently unsafe, among other issues. Timnit Gebru ends her talk with \"Don't attempt to build a god\"",
