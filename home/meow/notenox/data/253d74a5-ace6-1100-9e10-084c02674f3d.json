  "note": "John Carmack talks about his review of \"Bullshit Jobs\" by Graeber. Carmack argues that bullshit jobs are a \"luxury good\", where social status is defined by how many subserviants people wield in an organization. Carmack argues that Graeber, and presumably others of his philosophy, decry \"duct tapers\" who patch systems together in an ad-hoc way instead of making a system more efficient from a fundamental redesign, whereas Carmack argues that system redesign is a premature optimization and when enough ad-hoc \"duct tape\" solutions have been put in place, this signals a good place to do a redisgn.",
