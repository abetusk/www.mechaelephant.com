  "note": "Job interview questions to ask:\n* Tell me about a time a team member changed your mind\n* Tell me about someone you are proud of\n* Do you fully disconnect during holidays and vacations?\n* Describe a recent success or win\n* Tell me about a disagreement or conflict on the team\n* How did you start your last team meeting?\n* What is your ideal person for this role?\n* Who have you promoted and why?\n* Tellme about the last person you recognized (award, email, mentioned/validated in meeting)\n* How do you focus on your own growth and devlopment?\n\nThe advice is to learn about the manager instead of the company, since your experience at the company will mostly be tied to the experience you have with the manager",
