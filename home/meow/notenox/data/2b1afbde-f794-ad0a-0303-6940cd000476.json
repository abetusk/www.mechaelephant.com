  "note": "Deep South Ventures talks about doing a kind of 'MVP' for business by buying domain names that are expiring and creating a proof of concept around the name for validation. Besides not stepping into any trademarks, the general advice is to stick to .com domains, and limit to 1-2 words without any dashes or numbers. The different sites are NameJet, Snapnames, Dropcatch, Dynadot and Namecheap Auctions.",
