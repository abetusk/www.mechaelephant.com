  "note": "Talks about what shapes zero-sum thinking. Democrats look to be slightly more zero-sum than republicans. Some takeaways:\n* tend to think less zero-sum as we age\n* black americans tend to be more zero-sum while asian americans look to be less, with white near the middle but leaning towards more zero-sum\n* weirdly $55-$75k income looks to be least zero-sum with income above and below progressively more zero-sum\n* 2-4 year college middle or less zero-sum with postgraduate the most zero-sum thinking\n* strong democrat by far the most zero-sum thinkers with republicans the least, even below independent\nIt looks like one take away is that if, in the first 20 years of your life, you've seen growth and mobility, you tend to think of the world more in positive sum.",
