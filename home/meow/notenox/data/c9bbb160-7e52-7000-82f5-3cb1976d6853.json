  "note": "An article on group dynamics that lists three group dynamics that are common:\n\n* sex talk: groups facilitate pairs coupling for emotional and romantic interaction\n* vilification of an external enemy: focusing on an external villain, justified or not, helps unify the group\n* idolation: some person or idea is thought of as being beyond reproach\n\nThe article has 'Three Things to Accept':\n\n* you cannot completely separate the social from the technical\n* there will be a core group of users that care about the integrity and success of the group and probably matter more than the uninvested user\n* the core group has rights more than the average user\nWhere the '... to Accept' part is stressed that these are thing you have to accept because they'll happen anyway if you don't accept them upfront.\nThe recommendations on what to design for:\n* allow for monikers that users can invest in, both the owner of the moniker and the people interacting with the moniker\n* have systems in place that reward members for being in good standing\n* create appropriate barriers to participation\n* create some way to shield groups from scale",
