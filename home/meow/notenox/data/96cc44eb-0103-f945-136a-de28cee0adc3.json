  "note": "Short article on floyd-steinberg and atkinson dithering. Ultimately pretty simple. The FS algorithm goes in a single sweep of a grayscale image. If the pixel is greater than some threshold (0.5), it's on. For the overflow (pixel[pos]-threshold) distribute to nearest neighbor pixels after it: [+1,7/16], [+w-1,3/16], [+w,5/16], [+w+1,1/16]",
