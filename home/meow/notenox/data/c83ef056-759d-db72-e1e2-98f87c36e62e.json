  "note": "Combinatorial Number Systems allow for enumeration of ${\\binom n k}$. That is, given $n$ symbols from $[0,n)$, generate all lists of length $k$ that represent a sampling from the $n$ symbols. One interesting fact that if $0 \\le c_1 < c2 < \\cdots < c_{k-1} < c_k < n$ then $ \\sum_{j=1}^{k} {\\binom {c_j} j} \\in [0,{\\binom n k} )$. That is, the sum enumerates all possibilities. The proof is by induction on $n+1,k+1$.",
