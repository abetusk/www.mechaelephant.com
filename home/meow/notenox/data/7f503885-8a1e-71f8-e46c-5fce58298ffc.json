  "note": "\"ExpertFrom a World That No Longer Exists\" by Morgan Housel.\nOne quote attributed to Marc Andreessen:\n> Pets.com was mocked, but Chewy is now a $30 billion business. Webvan failed, but Instacart and UberEats are now thriving. eToys was a joke, but now look at Amazon. Some of the biggest businesses of the last 10 years are all in industries that were the starkest examples of stupidity 20 years ago.\n",
