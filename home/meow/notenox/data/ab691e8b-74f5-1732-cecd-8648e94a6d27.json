  "note": "Jarek Duda has done work on assymetric numeral systems, , constrained coding, joint reconstruction codes and maximal entropy random walk, to name a few. The assymetric numeral system ideas are (apparently) used in zstd to acheive higher compression rates that can run at faster speeds. The maximum entroyp random walks help is getting agreement between random walks and some quantum mechanic predictions.",
