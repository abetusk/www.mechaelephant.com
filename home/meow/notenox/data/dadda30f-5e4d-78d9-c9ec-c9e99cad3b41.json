  "note": "A Twitter thread about which is worse: minting an NFT or selling 100 T-shirts.\nProfits from 100 T-Shirts compared with 1 NFT is about equal (.5k?). T-Shirts are an order of magnitude more costly in terms of CO2 emissions. T-Shirts (cotton) can take up to 270k liters of water (for 100).\nHemp shirts and prints are discussed as well.\n",
