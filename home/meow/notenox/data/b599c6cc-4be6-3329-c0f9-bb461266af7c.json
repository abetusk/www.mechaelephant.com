  "note": "Talks about the evolution from a zero-sum game mentality where we're in a steady state of population size, keeping the population down with warfare and potentially (female) infanticide, to one where we've invested in innovation. 300k years is a long time for population to remain stagnant. Even at 0.05\\% growth, it would have only taken a 1k+ years to reach our level, so the time we've been in a sort of steady state or equilibrium has been long",
