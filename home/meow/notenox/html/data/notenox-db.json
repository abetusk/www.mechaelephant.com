    "note": "Talks about the 'virtuous cycle' of coal, iron and steam. From 1200 onwards, the UK had coal available to it. Eventually the invention of chimneys to allow for coal to be used as heat were invented, allowing people to cluster in the city, removing the dependence on hearth stoves and on wood. From there, demand for coal went up.\nNewcomen's engine was used to pump water from coal pits, where the coal pits were becoming deeper as demand grew. The author claims that Newcomen's engine was only economical at the pithead, giving a good reason why steam engines were invented in Britain and nowhere else: because first generation steam engines were only economical when cheap fuel was readily available next to it.\nThe widespread use of coal eventually led to a plentiful and cheap coke, a by-product of coal with fewer impurities that prevented iron from being contaminated when being heated by it. Coke also didn't suffer from compression issues that coal had, so it could be packed more densly, allowing for larger furnaces that could reach the temperatures needed to melt iron (2800F+). This was around the 1750s.\nIron made with coke was still too impure and needed to be refined further. A 'puddling furnace' was created in the 1780s that appied heat while being stirred to help create the wrought iron.",

Further, particles will prefer to diffuse out. This leads to two equations for the different particles operating on a grid with the particles considered as concentrations on a grid. The laplacian term is meant to cause diffusion (second derivative positive -> diffuse in (basin, ++), negative -> diffuse out (top of hill, --)). The ABB term is the reaction and the F and K terms of the feed and kill terms for particles A and B respectively.",

The idea is that there are basically three phases for a militarily weaker force that needs to be employed instead of doing a full head on offensive:\n* Guerrilla warfare - sabotage and assination on opposition\n* Mobile Warfare - 'hit-and-run' tactics that quickly target weaker forces then retreat\n* Positional Warfare - convential warfare, attempting to take and hold territory\nSome additional tidbits:\n* Funding more easily comes from a sponsor nation state than from taking enemy resources\n* 'The will of the people' (aka propaganda) and keeping the people's favoritism is key, either through coersion, benefits or mutual hate of the opposition (for example, opposition's use of collective punishment for guerrilla like strikes), to effectively mount insurgency and ultimate victory (that is, mobilize people, not industry)\n* Collatoral damage will be high and lead to oppressive policies from the occupiers (and most likely guide insurgency governments to also be draconian)\n* Being able to gracefully go back down a level if an attempt to advance to a higher level fails helps shield against defeat (Mao thought of 'many small victories' but resilience against many small defeats might also be key)\n* From foreign support comes a need to conform to foreign ideoligy\n* Protracted war is very beatable with most insurgencies losing and depends on the desire of the occupying force vs. the occupied force to win\n* New technologies, with heavy emphasis on media and global communication, can drastically change the course and tactics of protracted war\n* Tactics of the weaker force for a protracted war are born out of necessity. By far, winning wars of quick decisions are more desirable",

You collect ingredients from the mini-marts and shopping centers littered in the post apacolyptic landscape to supply the truck. The truck can run over zombies at a point cost.

Death rates for 'no high school' group is significantly higher (like 10x more than college degree) but he talks about this (potentially?) being an issue with higher degree and education being more common, essentially leaving the 'no high school' cohort with only the people at higher risk but reducing the overall count. That is, education is rising over time, so the looking at the cohort without considering its size might be misleading. Some other choice graphs are that mortality rate of black men and women are decreasing with 2015 mortality rates for black men and women reaching about the same levels of the corresponding white education cohort for 1995, though the least educated white cohort are significantly at higher risk of mortality than black folks in a similar education percentile. 50+ mortality rates for the lowest educated white cohort are more from other health causes (not listed), not from diseases of despair (suicide, alcohol, overdoce, etc.). Yet another choice graph is the hourly rate by education. There's a spike in 1995 region, presumably with the advent of the internet and college/advanced degrees accounting for the wage increase being from technical fields (CS, etc.) but also what looks to be a spike in 1965 region (though it's hard to tell because the graph starts at 1965) from what I would guess is the automotive boom (all education levels rise, so presumably wouldn't be accounted by electronics boom).",

Most food comes from small to mid sized farms (68%). Small to mid sized farms aren't being pushed out by bigger farms, they are the largest share. Farms, though they don't make money, are a pocket for wealth (like an investment property) and farms are not about making food so much as they're about putting land into white hands. That is, the real business model is land speculation. 95% family owned, 90% have supplimental income -> 90% that use farms as side/hobby.",

The idea is that the dragon curve can be created through in iterated function system (IFS) by choosing (randomely?) between $f_z(x)=1+zx$ and $g_z(x)=1-zx$ for some complex z and initial $x=0$. The iteration of $\\{f, g, -f, -g\\}$ trace out all Littlewood polynomials for initial values of $f(0)$ and $g(0)$.\nFor a set of \"dragon-like curve\" points $S_z$, from an initial $z$, if $0 \\\\in S_z$, this means there's a Littlewood polynomial where at least some of the roots are at least pretty close to the points in $S_z$\nThere's still the issue of figuring out what's happening in the center circle, the circles on the perimeter and the points outside of the ring of convergence but that's a description of at least one phenomena",

    "note": "The Hayflick limit is the number of times a cell can divide. In humans, this looks to be in the range of 40 to 60. When a cell can no longer divide, it's said to enter a senescence state, aka the cessation of cellular division.\nA conclusion that can be draw is that cell division which allows benefits against cancer and toxicity at an early age will inevitably cause 'old-age' diseases as cells will eventually reach their Hayflick limit, reach senescence and leave the organism susceptible to cancer and other disease of decrepitude. In other words, the resilience of youth via rapid cell division leads to an inevitable susceptibility to illness in old age.\nWilliams proposes a 'antagonistic pleiotrophy hypothesis' that says if a pleiotropic gene (a gene controlling more than one phenotype) is beneficial early on in life but detrimental later, then senescence will be selected for. For example, testosterone might give benefits early in life but create hazards in the form of cancer, say, later in life. Since the benefits to reproduction are high, the gene is selected for, even though it confers a higher chance of death later in life. In this case, senescence can be used to quell the testosterone production to minimize the detrimental effects.\nI think the idea is that there are many genes that give short term gain but have long term hazards that can be effectively muted with senescence. In some sense, senescence itself has the same property, giving gains in the short term (a humans life time) at the expense of longer life.",

He describes the basic process of having a failure, overlearning a lesson to outsource, demotivating engaged employees by outsourcing the technology they feel passionate about and how shareholders encourage 'zombie companies' because the numbers look good, until the momentum stops and the company fails from lack of innovation. Hubert's suggestion is to be engaged with the politics of the company early to make sure it stays on the right track or, barring that, starting your own. Hubert also recommends a paper: 'Out-Sourcing Pofits' by Hart-Smith from Boeing. A rule of thumb is that a company that controls less than 10% of their product is susceptible to collapse.",

    "note": "Steve from Stevesmakerspace created a simple visualization of HSB colors from a list of hand curated palettes (taken from coolors.co) to try and find patterns in the choices. Looking at them myself, I see the standard 'primary + neighbors and opposite' but also a kind of 'spiral' out from the center. Then there are 'lopsided' palettes that don't seem to conform to color theory that's normally discussed. I suspect these lopsided ones are because of the mismatch between HSV and CIE but the visualization at least starts to get at what's similar about some of the color palettes. The next question is what is a good visualization for CIE for hand curated color palettes that will give some insight into why hand curated palettes are so much better than random ones.\nAs a side note, Steve uses a perlin noise field overlay for some of the 2d flow field art to create a sort of random grouping of elements from the same color. This adds some local spatial cohesion to the elements by having them be similar colors that adds a lot of visual interest.",

For example, the Hough transform above assumes the rho-theta space for the description of a line, but one could have a 3d space, say, of circles described by their centers and radii. The Hough transform would then be accumulating all possible circles that can go through a point.\nThe Hough transform can be generalized to any parameterized shape, with the Hough space being an M dimensional (parameter) space of shapes defined by M parameters that give candidates of what the input shapes might be.\nThe Radon transform reads from the range of input to write to the (Radon space) output whereas the Hough transform reads a single input value and writes the range of possbile values in the output.

One reaction to a twitter response is 'ugh randos' in that the response is about jockeying for social heirarchy and taking the speaker down a notch to advance one's own social status. Another interpretation is that the response is a reaction to what is perceived as a gift to the commons, with their own response being either another gift to the commons or establishing social repor with the person giving the gift. Whereas someone jockeying for social position would be angry at having their response be corrected, the 'gift to the commons' folks are happy if they are corrected, as it means their gift was received in the spirit it was given and another gift was given in response (correcting them).\nAnother post talks about 'tact filters', where normal folks put a tact filter on what they use to speak and 'nerds' use a tact filter on the receiving side.",

    "note": "Stephen Diehl comments further about ransomware being soley enabled by cryptocurrency (and predicts) a huge storm coming. Stephen Diehl also makes a comparison with MLMs and our 'get-rich-quick' vulnerability.\nPaul Krugman writes about Bitcoin being a scam and how government can and will come in to regulate and supress it.\nZach Coelius says\n\n> I challenge anyone to name a crypto use case that can't be better executed by a centralized database except crime. Anyone?\n\nThe Coelius quote sums up most succinctly the push back against cryptocurrency and, in my opinion, it's deep utility. There are legitimate uses of cryptocurrency that get feature parity with fiat currency but people correctly point out that if fiat currency is working, then why bother developing anything that replaces it.\nAlmost by definition, if a financial alternative can be done that circumvents a regulated financial system under government control, it's probably illegal. Cryptocurrency has the potential to circumvent that control. The crime is not really the issue, the morality is. If governments provide illegal but immoral laws preventing a fair financial system, then anything that tries to replace is, almost by definition, illegal. Criminality should never be confused with imorality. Diehl, Krugman and Coelius all make this mistake.\n\nSome other points:\n* I've heard of a few anecdotal stories about Bitcoin being difficult to use but the only alternative to get money to people in certain situations\n* In the late 1800s, the Sears catalog offered black consumers access to goods that were restricted to them from entrenched racist local businesses\n* Wikileaks was able to get funds through cryptocurrency after their bank accounts had been seized by the government\n* Krugman has, as with many othrs, been profoundly wrong about the impact of technology and separating the winners in the technological and business race",

I don't know enough to make good critiques of Hickel's point but some things that jump out at me:\n* $7.04, or even $5.04, seems high for a global measure of extreme poverty\n* While $7.40/day might be a better measure of living wage, this is one threshold which doesn't address any idea of some type of progress of wages below that threshold. For example, there might have been a large shift from under $1.90 to $5, say, while a smaller shift from above $7.04 to below which could still be considered a better situation than what just looking at the one $7.04 threshold might imply.\n* discarding all data pre-1981 seems pretty extreme. It might be an imperfect measure but, under some assumptions, it might be more reasonable to accept them with some caveats",

Use import elsewhere to use them (import { x } from \"./path/to/mymodule.js\")\n* can assign window values to make them globally available (in module: window.myval = val)\n* you can use objects directly as \"import { foo } from \"mymodule\", rename it as \"import { foo as bar } from \"mymodule\" or group them as \"import * as mm from \"mymodule\"\n* You can't reassign variables from a module import, but I guess it's shallow and lets you circumvent it?

    "note": "SIFT works by creating a bank of rescaled images (\"octaves\") that are then blurred (\"scale space\") (Gaussian kernel). The Laplacian (second derivative of luminance of image) can be approximated by the blurred images in an octave that are subtracted with each other. Though conceptually not correct, as the difference of blurred images are being used for more than just speeding up edge detection, I think that's one of the main aspects of it. Take the edges in each octave of the difference of Gaussians, find the maxima in a tiny cube of the stacked differences (27 pixel window) and that's the keypoint.\nAssign an orientation to the keypoint by taking the maximum of the (blurred) image's gradient information, creating a new keypoint if there are multiple peaks above some threshold.\nAssign a fingerprint around each keypoint by considering a 16x16 window made of 4x4 smaller pixel bins. For each 4x4 pixel bin, calculate the gradient magnitude of the original image and average for each 4x4 window, weighting the magnitude of each by a Gaussian weighted function. Reorient the gradients by the keypoint orientation to finally give your fingerprint.\nThere's a lot of filtering that needs to be done to discard points near the edge and only filtering keypoints or edges that pass some threshold test.\n The \"octaves\" give the scale invariance. They keypoint orientation gives the rotational invariance. The approximation to the Laplacian gives (partially) higher entropy regions. I'm still not sure what the selection of the keypoints at a particular octave (but varying \"scale\") is doing.",

The article goes on to talk about how a 'back of the envelope' calculation done with Dunbar's number can give an approximation of the phase transition point before the community needs to deal with scaling issues.\nThe argument is that you can trust your friends to have good faith arguments (Dunbar's number of about 150), you can trust your friends-of-friends to have good faith arguments and you can probably trust some portion of your friends of friends of friends to have good faith arguments giving us about $150^2.5$, as a rough estimate. Taking friends of friends as a lower bound and friends of friends of friends as an upper bound, this gives a window of 30k to 3M before communities need to start worrying about scaling effects.",

    "note": "[Daniel Sockwell] talks about the 'Ideal Language for Writing Free Software'. Though it sounds a little preposterous, [Sockwell] notices that most FOSS projects are one or just a few maintainers whereas corporations tend to have access to larger teams and higher turnover. For a project with a small number of devoted maintainers, expertise in language is rewarded as the few are more productive whereas in a corporate context, expertise is selected against as onboarding requires more resources and turnover is much higher.\nFor example, Golang is 'boring' and encourages idiomatic, standardized code creation, allowing for easy onboarding and lower impact when developers leave. Languages with higher expertise ceilings (C, Javascript, Perl) allow for more expressiveness, power and speed of programming beneficial to a single developer.",

She argues that after the first world war, it was more apparent to folks coming out of the war that class issues were the primary cause of inequality and, presumably, the cause of the war in some sense. The austerity measures that were promoted by economists of the time would serve as a template for future austerity measuers\\nBy claiming the need to save, social services can be cut weakening social mobility and the ability of common workers to gain political or social power. Keeping unemployment high provides a mechanism to weaken worker bargaining power. By reframing the economy as one in which it's harmonious and \"natural\", the focus shifts from being about class warfare and extolling the virtues of entrepreneurs, not only putting the responsibility on the individual but making the argument \"that prioritizes the saving of the investing elite as the real engine of the economic machine.\"",

One moral is finding the ground state energy might not actually be the configuration for a netowrk (with labelled edges, MRF, etc) that you want and computing on the marginals is better. The difference between payin $10 for the ground state vs. $1 for each correct labelling of a vertex. Computing the Bethe free energy, BP can explore the landscape of possible models.\\nA note about spectral methods. For random matricies, there's the semi circle law for the eigenvalues. The 'signal' is for eigenvalues that fall outside of the random noise of the semi circular area for eigenvalues. For graphs that have hubs (what Moore calls 'sparse' but maybe have more power law like degree behavior?) trying to patch up the graph by disallowing local backtracking or other 'teleportation' methods might work.\\nFrom a high level, there's one regime where you can't guess the underlying structure because you don't have enough information, so the best you can do is random chance. There's another regime where there's a global minima but only surrounding by an exponentially small area that would converge to it. Another region where there's a global minima but exponentially many areas around it to find them, so easy to find in general.\\nMoore is concerned with that region hard to find global minima and asking questions like how to sample (e.g. get metadata) from the graph so as to give you enough information to put you in that local region to converge to the global minima.",

At one point they talk about how you could eradicate poverty for a fraction of the cost without UBI but the article they link to is talking about using UBI to do that for the 15% or so below the poverty line. It goes on to say that a tax on financial transactions would make them disappear without expanding on how much. This seems more of a strawman argument than anything else. Providing a living wage paycheck to every citizen, regardless of employment or need is what Zamora talks about, without trying to make the better argument that UBI could be applied to a certain stratification of society and could be offset by other social services (healthcare, housing, food stamps, etc.).",

[RMS] has had a history of misogyny and other problematic behavior. There is a flood of Twitter comments and other documentation that talks about the cult of personality that has developed around [RMS] that has excused and sheltered his bad behavior as well as the contortions people have done in the past to try and correct it. The FSF's relevance and lack of ability to adapt is also coming into question. I'm collecting some of the Twitter threads and other responses.\n\nSpecifically, there's a thread about unionization at the FSF in direct response to guard against Stallman's personality. Talks of it being an 'open secret' that [RMS] was problematic at conferences and on campus (intituting a code of conduct etc.). ",
