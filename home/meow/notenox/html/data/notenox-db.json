You have to manuver the truck though the horde of zombies, which are attacked to food and noise. The truck makes a chiming noise when it has ingrediants to serve. You collect ingredients from the mini-marts and shopping centers littered in the post apacolyptic landscape to supply the truck. The truck can run over zombies at a point cost. Zombies are maybe put into cages at the end of the truck so they can be converted back to human at the base camp. Idea is to combine some aspects of unrailed and overcooked. Maybe different zombies require different recipes.",

Most food comes from small to mid sized farms (68%). Small to mid sized farms aren't being pushed out by bigger farms, they are the largest share. Farms, though they don't make money, are a pocket for wealth (like an investment property) and farms are not about making food so much as they're about putting land into white hands. That is, the real business model is land speculation. 95% family owned, 90% have supplimental income -> 90% that use farms as side/hobby.",

After the industrial revolution, this was false (food production was exponential) but it looks like even before the industrial revolution, it was also exponential, with gains happening in densily populated areas. The main limiting factor of population growth looks to be disease and, before hygene, this meant densely populated regions had higher rates of pestilence because bad sanity conditions allowed for disease spread.",

There is a flood of Twitter comments and other documentation that talks about the cult of personality that has developed around [RMS] that has excused and sheltered his bad behavior as well as the contortions people have done in the past to try and correct it. The FSF's relevance and lack of ability to adapt is also coming into question. I'm collecting some of the Twitter threads and other responses.\n\nSpecifically, there's a thread about unionization at the FSF in direct response to guard against Stallman's personality. Talks of it being an 'open secret' that [RMS] was problematic at conferences and on campus (intituting a code of conduct etc.). ",
