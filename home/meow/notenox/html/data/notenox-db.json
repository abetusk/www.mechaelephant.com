You have to manuver the truck though the horde of zombies, which are attacked to food and noise. The truck makes a chiming noise when it has ingrediants to serve. You collect ingredients from the mini-marts and shopping centers littered in the post apacolyptic landscape to supply the truck. The truck can run over zombies at a point cost. Zombies are maybe put into cages at the end of the truck so they can be converted back to human at the base camp. Idea is to combine some aspects of unrailed and overcooked.

Most food comes from small to mid sized farms (68%). Small to mid sized farms aren't being pushed out by bigger farms, they are the largest share. Farms, though they don't make money, are a pocket for wealth (like an investment property) and farms are not about making food so much as they're about putting land into white hands. That is, the real business model is land speculation. 95% family owned, 90% have supplimental income -> 90% that use farms as side/hobby.",

The main limiting factor of population growth looks to be disease and, before hygene, this meant densely populated regions had higher rates of pestilence because bad sanity conditions allowed for disease spread.",

He describes the basic process of having a failure, overlearning a lesson to outsource, demotivating engaged employees by outsourcing the technology they feel passionate about and how shareholders encourage 'zombie companies' because the numbers look good, until the momentum stops and the company fails from lack of innovation. Hubert's suggestion is to be engaged with the politics of the company early to make sure it stays on the right track or, barring that, starting your own. Hubert also recommends a paper: 'Out-Sourcing Pofits' by Hart-Smith from Boeing. A rule of thumb is that a company that controls less than 10% of their product is susceptible to collapse.",

Stephen Diehl also makes a comparison with MLMs and our 'get-rich-quick' vulnerability.\nPaul Krugman writes about Bitcoin being a scam and how government can and will come in to regulate and supress it.\nZach Coelius says\n\n> I challenge anyone to name a crypto use case that can't be better executed by a centralized database except crime. Anyone?\n\nThe Coelius quote sums up most succinctly the push back against cryptocurrency and, in my opinion, it's deep utility. There are legitimate uses of cryptocurrency that get feature parity with fiat currency but people correctly point out that if fiat currency is working, then why bother developing anything that replaces it.\nAlmost by definition, if a financial alternative can be done that circumvents a regulated financial system under government control, it's probably illegal. Cryptocurrency has the potential to circumvent that control. The crime is not really the issue, the morality is. If governments provide illegal but immoral laws preventing a fair financial system, then anything that tries to replace is, almost by definition, illegal. Criminality should never be confused with imorality. Diehl, Krugman and Coelius all make this mistake.\n\nSome other points:\n* I've heard of a few anecdotal stories about Bitcoin being difficult to use but the only alternative to get money to people in certain situations\n* In the late 1800s, the Sears catalog offered black consumers access to goods that were restricted to them from entrenched racist local businesses\n* Wikileaks was able to get funds through cryptocurrency after their bank accounts had been seized by the government\n* Krugman has, as with many othrs, been profoundly wrong about the impact of technology and separating the winners in the technological and business race",

At one point they talk about how you could eradicate poverty for a fraction of the cost without UBI but the article they link to is talking about using UBI to do that for the 15% or so below the poverty line. It goes on to say that a tax on financial transactions would make them disappear without expanding on how much. This seems more of a strawman argument than anything else. Providing a living wage paycheck to every citizen, regardless of employment or need is what Zamora talks about, without trying to make the better argument that UBI could be applied to a certain stratification of society and could be offset by other social services (healthcare, housing, food stamps, etc.).",

There is a flood of Twitter comments and other documentation that talks about the cult of personality that has developed around [RMS] that has excused and sheltered his bad behavior as well as the contortions people have done in the past to try and correct it. The FSF's relevance and lack of ability to adapt is also coming into question. I'm collecting some of the Twitter threads and other responses.\n\nSpecifically, there's a thread about unionization at the FSF in direct response to guard against Stallman's personality. Talks of it being an 'open secret' that [RMS] was problematic at conferences and on campus (intituting a code of conduct etc.). ",
