    "note": "Talks about the 'virtuous cycle' of coal, iron and steam. From 1200 onwards, the UK had coal available to it. Eventually the invention of chimneys to allow for coal to be used as heat were invented, allowing people to cluster in the city, removing the dependence on hearth stoves and on wood. From there, demand for coal went up.\nNewcomen's engine was used to pump water from coal pits, where the coal pits were becoming deeper as demand grew. The author claims that Newcomen's engine was only economical at the pithead, giving a good reason why steam engines were invented in Britain and nowhere else: because first generation steam engines were only economical when cheap fuel was readily available next to it.\nThe widespread use of coal eventually led to a plentiful and cheap coke, a by-product of coal with fewer impurities that prevented iron from being contaminated when being heated by it. Coke also didn't suffer from compression issues that coal had, so it could be packed more densly, allowing for larger furnaces that could reach the temperatures needed to melt iron (2800F+). This was around the 1750s.\nIron made with coke was still too impure and needed to be refined further. A 'puddling furnace' was created in the 1780s that appied heat while being stirred to help create the wrought iron.",

Farms, though they don't make money, are a pocket for wealth (like an investment property) and farms are not about making food so much as they're about putting land into white hands. That is, the real business model is land speculation. 95% family owned, 90% have supplimental income -> 90% that use farms as side/hobby.",

    "note": "The Hayflick limit is the number of times a cell can divide. In humans, this looks to be in the range of 40 to 60. When a cell can no longer divide, it's said to enter a senescence state, aka the cessation of cellular division.\nA conclusion that can be draw is that cell division which allows benefits against cancer and toxicity at an early age will inevitably cause 'old-age' diseases as cells will eventually reach their Hayflick limit, reach senescence and leave the organism susceptible to cancer and other disease of decrepitude. In other words, the resilience of youth via rapid cell division leads to an inevitable susceptibility to illness in old age.\nWilliams proposes a 'antagonistic pleiotrophy hypothesis' that says if a pleiotropic gene (a gene controlling more than one phenotype) is beneficial early on in life but detrimental later, then senescence will be selected for. For example, testosterone might give benefits early in life but create hazards in the form of cancer, say, later in life. Since the benefits to reproduction are high, the gene is selected for, even though it confers a higher chance of death later in life. In this case, senescence can be used to quell the testosterone production to minimize the detrimental effects.\nI think the idea is that there are many genes that give short term gain but have long term hazards that can be effectively muted with senescence. In some sense, senescence itself has the same property, giving gains in the short term (a humans life time) at the expense of longer life.",

He describes the basic process of having a failure, overlearning a lesson to outsource, demotivating engaged employees by outsourcing the technology they feel passionate about and how shareholders encourage 'zombie companies' because the numbers look good, until the momentum stops and the company fails from lack of innovation. Hubert's suggestion is to be engaged with the politics of the company early to make sure it stays on the right track or, barring that, starting your own. Hubert also recommends a paper: 'Out-Sourcing Pofits' by Hart-Smith from Boeing. A rule of thumb is that a company that controls less than 10% of their product is susceptible to collapse.",

Another interpretation is that the response is a reaction to what is perceived as a gift to the commons, with their own response being either another gift to the commons or establishing social repor with the person giving the gift. Whereas someone jockeying for social position would be angry at having their response be corrected, the 'gift to the commons' folks are happy if they are corrected, as it means their gift was received in the spirit it was given and another gift was given in response (correcting them).\nAnother post talks about 'tact filters', where normal folks put a tact filter on what they use to speak and 'nerds' use a tact filter on the receiving side.",

    "note": "Stephen Diehl comments further about ransomware being soley enabled by cryptocurrency (and predicts) a huge storm coming. Stephen Diehl also makes a comparison with MLMs and our 'get-rich-quick' vulnerability.\nPaul Krugman writes about Bitcoin being a scam and how government can and will come in to regulate and supress it.\nZach Coelius says\n\n> I challenge anyone to name a crypto use case that can't be better executed by a centralized database except crime. Anyone?\n\nThe Coelius quote sums up most succinctly the push back against cryptocurrency and, in my opinion, it's deep utility. There are legitimate uses of cryptocurrency that get feature parity with fiat currency but people correctly point out that if fiat currency is working, then why bother developing anything that replaces it.\nAlmost by definition, if a financial alternative can be done that circumvents a regulated financial system under government control, it's probably illegal. Cryptocurrency has the potential to circumvent that control. The crime is not really the issue, the morality is. If governments provide illegal but immoral laws preventing a fair financial system, then anything that tries to replace is, almost by definition, illegal. Criminality should never be confused with imorality. Diehl, Krugman and Coelius all make this mistake.\n\nSome other points:\n* I've heard of a few anecdotal stories about Bitcoin being difficult to use but the only alternative to get money to people in certain situations\n* In the late 1800s, the Sears catalog offered black consumers access to goods that were restricted to them from entrenched racist local businesses\n* Wikileaks was able to get funds through cryptocurrency after their bank accounts had been seized by the government\n* Krugman has, as with many othrs, been profoundly wrong about the impact of technology and separating the winners in the technological and business race",

For a project with a small number of devoted maintainers, expertise in language is rewarded as the few are more productive whereas in a corporate context, expertise is selected against as onboarding requires more resources and turnover is much higher.\nFor example, Golang is 'boring' and encourages idiomatic, standardized code creation, allowing for easy onboarding and lower impact when developers leave. Languages with higher expertise ceilings (C, Javascript, Perl) allow for more expressiveness, power and speed of programming beneficial to a single developer.",

At one point they talk about how you could eradicate poverty for a fraction of the cost without UBI but the article they link to is talking about using UBI to do that for the 15% or so below the poverty line. It goes on to say that a tax on financial transactions would make them disappear without expanding on how much. This seems more of a strawman argument than anything else. Providing a living wage paycheck to every citizen, regardless of employment or need is what Zamora talks about, without trying to make the better argument that UBI could be applied to a certain stratification of society and could be offset by other social services (healthcare, housing, food stamps, etc.).",

The FSF's relevance and lack of ability to adapt is also coming into question. I'm collecting some of the Twitter threads and other responses.\n\nSpecifically, there's a thread about unionization at the FSF in direct response to guard against Stallman's personality.
