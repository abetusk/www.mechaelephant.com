The first is built using a half-bridge inverter and antennas with series-series compensation, while a microcontroller (Teensy 4.1) supplies high-frequency PWM signals. The measurement unit comprises high-speed operational amplifiers and an exclusive OR gate. A resistor was used as a load. As is well known, the maximum power transfer occurs at the resonance frequency, nevertheless, this depends physically on the geometry of the coupling system. Using a 3D-printed displacement system, we created controlled vertical misalignments between the coils, thereby obtaining variations in the resonance frequency of the system and consequently, producing a proportional phase shift between the voltage and current waves of the transmitting antenna. As the experimental results demonstrate, the measurement system is capable of processing and monitoring this high-frequency phase shift and subsequently used it as a control variable in a proportional-integral controller, which adjusts the operation frequency of the system and brings it back to optimal conditions. This precise yet inexpensive (USD 170) implementation could find its application in EVs and biomedical devices’ efficient wireless chargers.","primaryType":"Education","additionalType":["3D Printing","Electronics"],"projectKeywords":["Magnetic coupling"," misalignment"," phase shift"," resonance frequency"," microcontroller"," wireless power transfer"],"citations":[],"documentationUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5866775","hardwareLicense":"Other","softwareLicense":"MIT","documentationLicense":"Other","certificationDate":"2022-01-21T00:00-05:00"},{"oshwaUid":"DK000001","responsibleParty":"Technical University of Denmark","country":"Denmark","publicContact":"etehw@dtu.dk","projectName":"Low-Cost, Open-Source XYZ Nanopositioner for High-Precision Analytical Applications","projectWebsite":"https://osf.io/d9tws/","projectVersion":"1.0","projectDescription":"We present a design of an open-source XYZ-axis nanopositioning system that provides sub-nanometer resolution, a payload capacity of up to 12 kg (horizontal), compact size, low cost, and easy assembly; furthermore, the system is adjustment-free.

The microcontroller used in this project was the ESP32-WROVER.","primaryType":"IOT","additionalType":["3D Printing","Electronics"],"projectKeywords":["gas-sensor"," iot"," esp32"],"citations":[],"documentationUrl":"https://github.com/LuisEA21/GasSensorIOT","hardwareLicense":"CERN","softwareLicense":"GPL-3.0-or-later","documentationLicense":"CC-BY-4.0","certificationDate":"2022-06-10T00:00-04:00"},{"oshwaUid":"DE000058","responsibleParty":"Watterott electronic","country":"Germany","publicContact":"","projectName":"mSD-Bee","projectWebsite":"https://github.com/watterott/mSD-Bee","projectVersion":"","projectDescription":"mSD-Bee is a module with microSD Socket","primaryType":"Electronics","projectKeywords":["microSD"," Memory Card"],"citations":[],"documentationUrl":"https://learn.watterott.com/bee-modules/msd/","hardwareLicense":"Other","softwareLicense":"No software","documentationLicense":"CC BY-SA","certificationDate":"2020-05-20T00:00-04:00"},{"oshwaUid":"DE000040","responsibleParty":"Watterott electronic","country":"Germany","publicContact":"","projectName":"mSD-Breakout","projectWebsite":"https://github.com/watterott/mSD-Breakout","projectVersion":"","projectDescription":"Breakout with microSD socket and level shifter","primaryType":"Electronics","projectKeywords":["microSD"," memory card"],"citations":[],"documentationUrl":"https://learn.watterott.com/breakouts/msd-breakout/","hardwareLicense":"Other","softwareLicense":"No software","documentationLicense":"CC BY-SA","certificationDate":"2020-05-16T00:00-04:00"},{"oshwaUid":"DE000082","responsibleParty":"Watterott electronic","country":"Germany","publicContact":"","projectName":"mSD-Shield","projectWebsite":"https://github.com/watterott/mSD-Shield","projectVersion":"","projectDescription":"The mSD-Shield is a plug-on module with microSD socket, RTC (real time clock), prototyping area and optional 2.8” TFT-Display for Arduino.","primaryType":"Electronics","projectKeywords":["Arduino"," Logging"],"citations":[],"documentationUrl":"https://learn.watterott.com/shields/msd-shield/","hardwareLicense":"Other","softwareLicense":"No software","documentationLicense":"CC BY-SA","certificationDate":"2020-05-28T00:00-04:00"}]}
