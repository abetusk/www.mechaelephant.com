With these three components, unwanted noise on a signal or power line can often be filtered out rather quickly.","primaryType":"Electronics","projectKeywords":["SparkFun"," Rasberry Pi"],"citations":[],"documentationUrl":"https://github.com/sparkfunX/SparkX-Pi-Filter-Breakout","hardwareLicense":"CERN","softwareLicense":"MIT","documentationLicense":"CC BY-SA","certificationDate":"2020-12-07T00:00-05:00"},{"oshwaUid":"US000702","responsibleParty":"SparkFun Electronics","country":"United States of America","publicContact":"support@sparkfun.com","projectName":"SparkX Refrigeration Gas Sensor - ZMOD4450 (Qwiic)","projectWebsite":"https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16677","projectVersion":"v10","projectDescription":"The ZMOD4450 gas sensor from Renesas is a unique Refrigeration Air Quality sensor designed to measure gases emitted by food ripening or rotting: ethlyene, amines and volatile sulfur compounds.
