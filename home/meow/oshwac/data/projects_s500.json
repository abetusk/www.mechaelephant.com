This project is designed specifically for the Adafruit Itsy Bitsy 32u4 - 5V 16MHz, but any other Arduino-compatible MCU with similar specifications is usable with modification. For 5V/12V RGBW operation, you can choose between NPN or N-channel MOSFETs in a TO-220 package. A separate 12V power supply will be required for 12V operation. An XLR connector is provided as an alternative to the ARGB pin header for long cable runs.","primaryType":"Electronics","projectKeywords":["lighting"," dmx"," argb"," rgbw"," rgb"," midi"," live music"],"citations":[],"documentationUrl":"https://github.com/dcooperdalrymple/arduino-midi-argb-dmx/blob/main/README.md","hardwareLicense":"GPL-3.0-or-later","softwareLicense":"GPL-3.0-or-later","documentationLicense":"GPL-3.0-or-later","certificationDate":"2022-06-03T00:00-04:00"},{"oshwaUid":"UK000001","responsibleParty":"Hughski Limited","country":"United Kingdom","projectName":"ColorHug","projectWebsite":"http://www.hughski.com/","projectVersion":"2","projectDescription":"A display colorimeter.","primaryType":"Electronics","additionalType":["Arts","Tool"],"projectKeywords":["color","calibration","display"],"documentationUrl":"https://hughski.com/faq.html#openhardware","hardwareLicense":"CERN","softwareLicense":"GPL","documentationLicense":"CC BY-SA"}]}
