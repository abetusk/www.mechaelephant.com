This license may be particularly\nsuitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but\nyou may use it with small modifications even if your work is unrelated\nto TeX.\n\nThe section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',\nbelow, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors\nwho are considering distributing their works under this license.\n\nThis license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed\nand modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of\nthat work may be distributed.\n\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you\nthe freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work\nthat conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while\nmaintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of\nthat work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while\nmeeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'\nand `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n===========\n\nIn this license document the following terms are used:\n\n   `Work'\n    Any work being distributed under this License.\n    \n   `Derived Work'\n    Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.\n\n   `Modification' \n    Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable\n    law -- for example, the production of a file containing an\n    original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of\n    such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\n    translated into another language.\n\n   `Modify'\n    To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any\n    applicable law.\n    \n   `Distribution'\n    Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in\n    whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)\n    making any electronic components of the Work accessible by\n    file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file\n    systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).\n\n   `Compiled Work'\n    A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it\n    is directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may\n    include using installation facilities provided by the Work,\n    transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or\n    other activities.  Note that modification of any installation\n    facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.\n\n   `Current Maintainer'\n    A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is\n    no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under\n    any applicable law.\n\n   `Base Interpreter' \n    A program or process that is normally needed for running or\n    interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.    \n    A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these\n    are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each\n    external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used\n    interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the\n    license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a\n    \"LaTeX-Format\".\n\n\n\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n===========================================\n\n1.  Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work\nare not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In\nparticular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no\nrequirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.\n\n2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you\nreceived it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered\nmodification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived\nWork may be assumed under the terms of this clause.\n\n3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a\ncomplete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2\nabove, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that\nthe recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly\nas it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work\ndirectly from the Work.\n\n4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without\nrestriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may\nalso distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including\nCompiled Works generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works\ndistributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to\nbe updated versions of the Work.\n\n5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify\nyour copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,\nand compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on\nthe Derived Work.\n\n6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\ndistribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met\nfor every component of the Work unless that component clearly states\nin the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition.  Only\nthe Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption \nto a component of the Work. \n\n  a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement\n     for a component of the Work when that component is used with the\n     Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work\n     identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that\n     Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work\n     clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version\n     of this component to the user when used interactively with that\n     Base Interpreter.\n     \n  b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices\n     detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a\n     prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part\n     of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log\n     of the changes.\n  \n  c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,\n     including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version\n     of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)\n     the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the\n     Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that\n     they do provide such support for the Derived Work.\n\n  d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:\n\n       1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; \n          if your distribution of a modified component is made by\n          offering access to copy the modified component from a\n          designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\n          the Work from the same or some similar place meets this\n          condition, even though third parties are not compelled to\n          copy the Work along with the modified component;\n\n       2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified\n          copy of the Work.\n\n7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\ndistribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as\nthe Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled\nWork, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with\nregard to the Derived Work.\n\n8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do\nnot apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it\nbecomes identical to an  updated version of that component of the Work as\nit is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.\n\n9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative\nformat, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is\nthen produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or\nnullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of\napplying that process.\n     \n10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license\n       provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in\n       Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have\n       to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.\n      \n    b. If a Derived Work is distributed under this license, that\n       Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of\n       itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the \n       restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.\n\n11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to\nthe Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating\nsuch works with the Work by any means.\n\n12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent\ncomplete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.\n\n\nNO WARRANTY\n===========\n\nThere is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in\nwriting, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without\nwarranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not\nlimited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for\na particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance\nof the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you\nassume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\n\nIn no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing\nwill The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of\nthe Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work\nas permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any\ngeneral, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of\nany use of the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including,\nbut not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or\nlosses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to\noperate with any other programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said\nauthor or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such\ndamages.\n\n\nMAINTENANCE OF THE WORK\n=======================\n\nThe Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder\nexplicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in\nthe Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder\nor simply that is `author-maintained'.\n\nThe Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer\nwho has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error\nreports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail\naddress). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge\nor act upon these error reports.\n\nThe Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there\nis no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current\nMaintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means\nof communication for a period of six months, and there are no other\nsignificant signs of active maintenance.\n\nYou can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with\nany existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.\n\nIf the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of\nthe Work through the following steps:\n\n 1.  Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and\n     the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of\n     an Internet or similar search.\n\n 2.  If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work\n     is still maintained.\n\n  a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer\n     to update their communication data within one month.\n     \n  b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active\n     maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce\n     within the pertinent community your intention to take over\n     maintenance.  (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be\n     done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)\n\n 3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass\n     maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect\n     immediately upon announcement.\n     \n  b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright\n     Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you,\n     then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.  \n    \n 4.  If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above\n     and after three months your intention is challenged neither by\n     the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other\n     people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as\n     to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.\n     \n 5.  If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes\n     reachable once more within three months of a change completed\n     under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must\n     become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided\n     they then update their communication data within one month.\n\nA change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact\nthat the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.\n\nIf you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should\nimmediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous\nstatement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You should also\nannounce your new status to the same pertinent community as\nin 2b) above.\n\n\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE\n======================================================\n\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and\nrecommendations for authors who are considering distributing their\nworks under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in\nthis section.\n\nChoosing This License or Another License\n----------------------------------------\n\nIf for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*\nconditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then\ndo not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,\ndistribute your work under a different license.  You may use the text\nof this license as a model for your own license, but your license\nshould not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that\nyour work is distributed under the LPPL.\n\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains\nthe motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,\nfor example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public\nLicense (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your work is\nunrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be\nrelevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any\nlicense are encouraged to read it.\n\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own\npersonal use, without also meeting the above conditions for\ndistributing the modified component.  While you might intend that such\nmodifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by\naccident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or\nit may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified\nversion that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions\nof this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,\ncause problems for the community.  It is therefore usually in your\nbest interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public\none.  Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work\nwithout altering any of its licensed components.\n\nHow to Use This License\n-----------------------\n\nTo use this license, place in each of the components of your work both\nan explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work\nwas authored and/or last substantially modified.  Include also a\nstatement that the distribution and/or modification of that\ncomponent is constrained by the conditions in this license.\n\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\n\n  %% pig.dtx\n  %% Copyright 2003 M. Y. Name\n  %\n  % This work may be distributed and/or modified under the\n  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3\n  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\n  % The latest version of this license is in\n  %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt\n  % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX\n  % version 2003/12/01 or later.\n  %\n  % This work has the LPPL maintenance status \"maintained\".\n  % \n  % This Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.\n  %\n  % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\n  % and the derived file pig.sty.\n\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions\ngiven in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring\nto the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being\ngenerated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'\nreferring to any \"LaTeX-Format\", and both `Copyright Holder' and\n`Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.\n\nIf you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your\nWork, change \"maintained\" above into \"author-maintained\".  \nHowever, we recommend that you use \"maintained\" as the Maintenance\nsection was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to\nthe community even when you can no longer maintain and support it\nyourself.\n\n\nImportant Recommendations\n-------------------------\n\n Defining What Constitutes the Work\n\n   The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the\n   files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a\n   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.\n   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the\n   files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by\n   using a line such as:\n\n    % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\n   \n   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be\n   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you\n   to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be\n   entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise\n   the Work.\n",
  "PublicDomain": " Being in the public domain is not a license; rather, it means the\nmaterial is not copyrighted and no license is needed. Practically\nspeaking, though, if a work is in the public domain, it might as well\nhave an all-permissive non-copyleft free software license. Public\ndomain material is compatible with the GNU GPL.\n\nIf you want to release your work to the public domain, we encourage\nyou to use formal tools to do so. We ask people who make small\ncontributions to GNU to sign a disclaimer form; that's one\nsolution. If you're working on a project that doesn't have formal\ncontribution policies like that, CC0 is a good tool that anyone can\nuse. It formally dedicates your work to the public domain, and\nprovides a fallback license for cases where that is not legally\npossible.\n\nhttp://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:CC0\n\nSource: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#PublicDomain\n",
  "CPLv1.0": " Common Public License - v 1.0\n\nUpdated 16 Apr 2009\n\nAs of 25 Feb 2009, IBM has assigned the Agreement Steward role for the\nCPL to the Eclipse Foundation. Eclipse has designated the Eclipse\nPublic License (EPL) as the follow-on version of the CPL.\n\nTHE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON\nPUBLIC LICENSE (\"AGREEMENT\"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF\nTHE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n    documentation distributed under this Agreement, and \n\n    b) in the case\n    of each subsequent Contributor:\n\n    i) changes to the Program, and\n\n    ii) additions to the Program;\n\n    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\n    and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n    'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\n    such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's\n    behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program\n    which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\n    conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,\n    and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor\nwhich are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution\nalone or when combined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this\nAgreement, including all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n    copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,\n    publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the\n    Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative\n    works, in source code and object code form.\n\n    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n    license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such\n    Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This\n    patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution\n    and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the\n    Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\n    combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent\n    license shall not apply to any other combinations which include\n    the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\n    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other\n    entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for\n    claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\n    intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to\n    exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each\n    Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other\n    intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n    third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\n    distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to\n    acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\n    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n    sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n    the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form\nunder its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\n    b) its license agreement:\n\n    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n    warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n    warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n    implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n    for a particular purpose;\n\n    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all\n    liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement\n    are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;\n    and\n\n    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n    Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\n    reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for\n    software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and \n\n    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. \n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\nwithin the Program.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\nContribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\nRecipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain\nresponsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the\nlike. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use\nof the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a\ncommercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not\ncreate potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a\nContributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,\nsuch Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend\nand indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\")\nagainst any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising\nfrom claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party\nagainst the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts\nor omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its\ndistribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The\nobligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\ninfringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)\npromptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,\nand b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with\nthe Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\nclaim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those\nperformance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\nContributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor\nmust pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\nPROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY\nWARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\nOR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You are responsible for notifying the\n    Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the\n    Source if a contact means is provided. Red Hat will be acting as\n    maintainer of the Source and may provide an Electronic\n    Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made\n    available.

If You\n    distribute the Executable version under a different license You\n    must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from\n    this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n    Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n    Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\n    by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any\n    such terms You offer.\n\n    If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you\n    must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or\n    other materials provided with the product.\n\n3.7.

Except to the\nextent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\nsufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\nunderstand it. You must submit this LEGAL file to Red Hat for review,\nand You will not be able use the covered code in any means until\npermission is granted from Red Hat to allow for the inability to\ncomply due to statute or regulation.\n\n5.

A Contribution 'originates' from a\n            Contributor if it was added to the Program by such\n            Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's\n            behalf.

GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n     a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor\n        hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,\n        royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare\n        derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\n        distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n        Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code\n        and object code form.\n\n     b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor\n        hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,\n        royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make,\n        use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\n        Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\n        object code form. This patent license shall apply to the\n        combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the\n        time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\n        addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be\n        covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not\n        apply to any other combinations which include the\n        Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\n     c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants\n        the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no\n        assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program\n        does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property\n        rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any\n        liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity\n        based on infringement of intellectual property rights or\n        otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and\n        licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\n        responsibility to secure any other intellectual property\n        rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent\n        license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the\n        Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that\n        license before distributing the Program.\n\n     d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n        sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to\n        grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n 3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n    A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code\n    form under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n     a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n       \n     b. its license agreement:\n\n         i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n            warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n            warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement,\n            and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability\n            and fitness for a particular purpose;\n\n        ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all\n            liability for damages, including direct, indirect,\n            special, incidental and consequential damages, such as\n            lost profits;\n\n       iii. states that any provisions which differ from this\n            Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by\n            any other party; and\n\n        iv. states that source code for the Program is available from\n            such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it\n            in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n            used for software exchange.\n\n    When the Program is made available in source code form:\n       \n     a. it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\n     b. a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\n    Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous\n    location in the Program:\n\n        CopyrightÂ© {date here}, International Business Machines\n        Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.\n\n    In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the\n    originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that\n    reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator\n    of the Contribution.\n\n 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\n    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain\n    responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and\n    the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the\n    commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the\n    Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\n    which does not create potential liability for other\n    Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in\n    a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial\n    Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other\n    Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n    damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims,\n    lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against\n    the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or\n    omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its\n    distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The\n    obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\n    relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n    infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor\n    must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of\n    such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\n    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and\n    any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor\n    may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\n    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a\n    commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a\n    Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes\n    performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X,\n    those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial\n    Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\n    Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the\n    other Contributors related to those performance claims and\n    warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay\n    any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those\n    damages.  \n\n 5. NO WARRANTY\n\n    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\n    PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\n    ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n    ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\n    MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\n    Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\n    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes\n    all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this\n    Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of\n    program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss\n    of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption\n    of operations.\n\n 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\n    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT\n    NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,\n    INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\n    (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON\n    ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR\n    TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF\n    THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY\n    RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\n    SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n 7. GENERAL\n\n    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable\n    under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or\n    enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,\n    and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision\n    shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\n    provision valid and enforceable.\n\n    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor\n    with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a\n    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent\n    licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this\n    Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is\n    filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation\n    against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\n    lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations\n    of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such\n    Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\n    Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is\n    filed.\n\n    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\n    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of\n    this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable\n    period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all\n    Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient\n    agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\n    reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under\n    this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to\n    the Program shall continue and survive.\n\n    IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this\n    Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement\n    will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program\n    (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the\n    version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,\n    after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may\n    elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)\n    under the new version. No one other than IBM has the right to\n    modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a)\n    and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the\n    intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\n    whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All\n    rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement\n    are reserved.\n\n    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York\n    and the intellectual property laws of the United States of\n    America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action\n    under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action\n    arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any\n    resulting litigation.\n",

You are not required to\n   accept this License. However, nothing else grants You permission to\n   use, copy, modify or distribute the software or its derivative\n   works. These actions are prohibited by law if You do not accept\n   this License. Therefore, by modifying, copying or distributing the\n   software (or any work based on the software), You indicate your\n   acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and\n   conditions.

When code is released as a series of files, a\n    Modification is: (a) any addition to or deletion from the contents\n    of a file containing Covered Code; and/or (b) any new file or\n    other representation of computer program statements that contains\n    any part of Covered Code.\n\n1.10 \"Original Code\" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other\n     work as originally made available by Licensor under this License,\n     including the Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such\n     programs or works made available by Licensor under this License,\n     and that has been expressly identified by Licensor as such in the\n     header file(s) of such work; and (b) the object code compiled\n     from such Source Code and originally made available by Licensor\n     under this License.\n\n1.11 \"Personal Use\" means use of Covered Code by an individual solely\n     for his or her personal, private and non-commercial purposes. An\n     individual's use of Covered Code in his or her capacity as an\n     officer, employee, member, independent contractor or agent of a\n     corporation, business or organization (commercial or\n     non-commercial) does not qualify as Personal Use.\n\n1.12 \"Source Code\" means the human readable form of a program or other\n     work that is suitable for making modifications to it, including\n     all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition\n     files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an\n     executable (object code).\n\n1.13 \"You\" or \"Your\" means an individual or a legal entity exercising\n     rights under this License.

Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms and\n   conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You, effective\n   on the date You accept this License (via downloading or using\n   Covered Code or otherwise indicating your acceptance of this\n   License), a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive copyright\n   license, to the extent of Licensor's copyrights cover the Original\n   Code, to do the following:\n\n2.1 You may reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy Covered\n    Code, provided that in each instance:\n\n (a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the\n     copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of\n     Licensor as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all\n     notices in the Original Code that refer to this License;\n\n (b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source\n     Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You\n     may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter\n     or restrict this License or the recipients' rights hereunder,\n     except as permitted under Section 6;\n\n (c) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the\n     notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your\n     Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent\n     notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any\n     change;\n\n (d) You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed\n     Modifications publicly available under the terms of this License,\n     including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as\n     long as you Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from\n     the date of initial Deployment, whichever is longer. You should\n     preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Deployed\n     Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site); and\n\n (e) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only,\n     You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well\n     as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the\n     Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with\n     information on how and where to obtain such Source Code. You must\n     also include the Object Code Notice set forth in Exhibit A in the\n     \"about\" box or other appropriate place where other copyright\n     notices are placed, including any packaging materials.\n\n2.2 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and\n    each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions\n    of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided\n    by Licensor or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not\n    infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any\n    other entity. Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability\n    to You for claims brought by any other entity based on\n    infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a\n    condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,\n    You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other\n    intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n    third party patent license is required to allow You to make, use,\n    sell, import or offer for sale the Covered Code, it is Your\n    responsibility to acquire such license(s).\n\n2.3 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor\n    hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License\n    (via downloading or using Covered Code or otherwise indicating\n    your acceptance of this License), a worldwide, royalty-free,\n    perpetual, non-exclusive patent license under Licensor's\n    Applicable Patent Rights to make, use, sell, offer for sale and\n    import the Covered Code, provided that in each instance you comply\n    with the terms of this License.\n\n3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the\n   licenses granted to You under this License:\n\n (a) You grant to Licensor and all third parties a non-exclusive,\n     perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free license under Your\n     Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights\n     owned or controlled by You, to make, sell, offer for sale, use,\n     import, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and\n     Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as\n     Licensor's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2; and\n\n (b) You grant to Licensor and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive,\n     worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under\n     Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property\n     rights owned or controlled by You, to make, use, sell, offer for\n     sale, import, reproduce, display, perform, distribute, modify or\n     have modified (for Licensor and/or its subsidiaries), sublicense\n     and distribute Your Modifications, in any form and for any\n     purpose, through multiple tiers of distribution.\n\n (c) You agree not use any information derived from Your use and\n     review of the Covered Code, including but not limited to any\n     algorithms or inventions that may be contained in the Covered\n     Code, for the purpose of asserting any of Your patent rights, or\n     assisting a third party to assert any of its patent rights,\n     against Licensor or any Contributor.\n\n4. Derivative Works. You may create a Derivative Work by combining\n   Covered Code with other code not otherwise governed by the terms of\n   this License and distribute the Derivative Work as an integrated\n   product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements\n   of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion\n   thereof, including all Modifications.\n\n4.1 You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute, publish or\n    Externally Deploy, that in whole or in part contains or is derived\n    from the Covered Code or any part thereof, to be licensed as a\n    whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this\n    License and no other license except as provided in Section\n    4.2. You also must make Source Code available for the Derivative\n    Work under the same terms as Modifications, described in Sections\n    2 and 3, above.\n\n4.2 Compatible Source Licenses. Software modules that have been\n    independently developed without any use of Covered Code and which\n    contain no portion of the Covered Code, Modifications or other\n    Derivative Works, but are used or combined in any way with the\n    Covered Code or any Derivative Work to form a larger Derivative\n    Work, are exempt from the conditions described in Section 4.1 but\n    only to the extent that: the software module, including any\n    software that is linked to, integrated with, or part of the same\n    applications as, the software module by any method must be wholly\n    subject to one of the Compatible Source Licenses. Notwithstanding\n    the foregoing, all Covered Code must be subject to the terms of\n    this License. Thus, the entire Derivative Work must be licensed\n    under a combination of the RPSL (for Covered Code) and a\n    Compatible Source License for any independently developed software\n    modules within the Derivative Work. The foregoing requirement\n    applies even if the Compatible Source License would ordinarily\n    allow the software module to link with, or form larger works with,\n    other software that is not subject to the Compatible Source\n    License. For example, although the Mozilla Public License v1.1\n    allows Mozilla code to be combined with proprietary software that\n    is not subject to the MPL, if MPL-licensed code is used with\n    Covered Code the MPL-licensed code could not be combined or linked\n    with any code not governed by the MPL. The general intent of this\n    section 4.2 is to enable use of Covered Code with applications\n    that are wholly subject to an acceptable open source license. You\n    are responsible for determining whether your use of software with\n    Covered Code is allowed under Your license to such software.\n\n4.3 Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Covered Code\n    with the Covered Code (or with a work based on the Covered Code)\n    on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the\n    other work under the scope of this License. If You deliver the\n    Covered Code for combination and/or integration with an\n    application previously provided by You (for example, via automatic\n    updating technology), such combination and/or integration\n    constitutes a Derivative Work subject to the terms of this\n    License.\n\n5. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be\n   deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents,\n   trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any\n   Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No right is granted\n   to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks\n   are included in the Covered Code. Nothing in this License shall be\n   interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different\n   terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have\n   a right to license. Modifications, Derivative Works and/or any use\n   or combination of Covered Code with other technology provided by\n   Licensor or third parties may require additional patent licenses\n   from Licensor which Licensor may grant in its sole discretion. No\n   patent license is granted separate from the Original Code or\n   combinations of the Original Code with other software or hardware.\n\n5.1. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the\n     trademarks or trade names owned by Licensor (\"Licensor Marks\"\n     defined in Exhibit C) or to any trademark or trade name belonging\n     to any Contributor. No Licensor Marks may be used to endorse or\n     promote products derived from the Original Code other than as\n     permitted by the Licensor Trademark Policy defined in Exhibit C.\n\n6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\n   warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other\n   rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein\n   (\"Additional Terms\") to one or more recipients of Covered\n   Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your\n   sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Licensor or any\n   Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any\n   such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby\n   agree to indemnify, defend and hold Licensor and every Contributor\n   harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against\n   Licensor or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional\n   Terms.\n\n7. Versions of the License. Licensor may publish revised and/or new\n   versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be\n   given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been\n   published under a particular version of this License, You may\n   continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also\n   choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent\n   version of this License published by Licensor. No one other than\n   Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered\n   Code created under this License.\n\n8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in\n   part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered\n   Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data,\n   and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly\n   acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion\n   thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS\n   PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY\n   KIND AND LICENSOR AND LICENSOR'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED\n   TO AS \"LICENSOR\" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL\n   CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS,\n   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\n   WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY\n   QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET\n   ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. LICENSOR AND\n   EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR\n   ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE\n   COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE\n   COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS\n   IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN\n   DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR, A LICENSOR\n   AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A\n   WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for\n   use in high risk activities, including, but not limited to, the\n   design, construction, operation or maintenance of nuclear\n   facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft communication systems, or\n   air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the\n   Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe\n   physical or environmental damage. Licensor disclaims any express or\n   implied warranty of fitness for such uses.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO\n   EVENT SHALL LICENSOR OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY\n   INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT\n   OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n   COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF\n   CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT\n   LIABILITY), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR OR\n   SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n   DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY\n   REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n   OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT\n   APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Licensor's total liability to You\n   for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law)\n   under this License exceed the amount of ten dollars ($10.00).\n\n10. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License,\n    each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to\n    any Modifications made by such Contributor. Licensor retains all\n    rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any\n    Modifications made by or on behalf of Licensor (\"Licensor\n    Modifications\"), and such Licensor Modifications will not be\n    automatically subject to this License. Licensor may, at its sole\n    discretion, choose to license such Licensor Modifications under\n    this License, or on different terms from those contained in this\n    License or may choose not to license them at all.\n\n11. Termination.\n\n11.1 Term and Termination. The term of this License is perpetual\n     unless terminated as provided below. This License and the rights\n     granted hereunder will terminate:\n\n (a) automatically without notice from Licensor if You fail to comply\n     with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach\n     within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach;\n\n (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in\n     Section 12.5(b); or\n\n (c) automatically without notice from Licensor if You, at any time\n     during the term of this License, commence an action for patent\n     infringement against Licensor (including by cross-claim or\n     counter claim in a lawsuit);\n\n (d) upon written notice from Licensor if You, at any time during the\n     term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement\n     against any third party alleging that the Covered Code itself\n     (excluding combinations with other software or hardware)\n     infringes any patent (including by cross-claim or counter claim\n     in a lawsuit).\n\n11.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately\n     stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing\n     and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of\n     the Covered Code that are in your possession or control. All\n     sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted\n     prior to termination shall survive any termination of this\n     License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in\n     effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive,\n     including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2\n     and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation,\n     indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of\n     terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and\n     termination of this License will be without prejudice to any\n     other right or remedy of any party.\n\n12. Miscellaneous.\n\n12.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a \"commercial item\" as\n     defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data\n     rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily\n     provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary\n     commercial license in technical data and software is provided in\n     accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer\n     Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR\n     252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3\n     (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software\n     Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users\n     acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n\n12.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as\n     creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form\n     of legal association between or among You, Licensor or any\n     Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether\n     expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.\n\n12.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair\n     Licensor's right to acquire, license, develop, have others\n     develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products\n     that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise\n     compete with, Modifications, Derivative Works, technology or\n     products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.\n\n12.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Licensor or any Contributor to\n     enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver\n     of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or\n     regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall\n     be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.\n\n12.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent\n     jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion\n     thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will\n     be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the\n     economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of\n     this License will continue in full force and effect. (b)\n     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or\n     restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with\n     Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of\n     those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You\n     must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and\n     destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.\n\n12.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution\n     between You and Licensor relating to this License shall take\n     place in the Seattle, Washington, and You and Licensor hereby\n     consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state\n     and federal courts within that District with respect to this\n     License. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly\n     excluded.\n\n12.7 Export/Import Laws. This software is subject to all export and\n     import laws and restrictions and regulations of the country in\n     which you receive the Covered Code and You are solely responsible\n     for ensuring that You do not export, re-export or import the\n     Covered Code or any direct product thereof in violation of any\n     such restrictions, laws or regulations, or without all necessary\n     authorizations.\n\n12.8 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the\n     entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject\n     matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the\n     United States and the State of Washington.\n\nWhere You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following\nclause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested\nthat this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les\nparties ont exigÃ© que le prÃ©sent contrat et tous les documents\nconnexes soient rÃ©digÃ©s en anglais.\n\nEXHIBIT A.\n\n\"Copyright Â© 1995-2002 RealNetworks, Inc. and/or its licensors.

The license\n  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,\n  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.\n\n  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG\n  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion\n  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products\n  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:\n\n    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be\n      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)\n\n    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or\n      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)\n\n    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use\n      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge\n      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the\n      FreeType code. (`credits')\n\n  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this\n  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.\n  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and\n  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.\n\n\n  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a\n  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.

  "LPPLv1.2": " The LaTeX Project Public License\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nLPPL Version 1.2  1999-09-03\n\nCopyright 1999 LaTeX3 Project\n    Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this\n    license document, but modification of it is not allowed.\n\n\nPREAMBLE\n========\n\nThe LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the\nbase LaTeX distribution is distributed.\n\nYou may use this license for any program that you have written and wish\nto distribute.  This license may be particularly suitable if your\nprogram is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it\neven if your program is unrelated to TeX.  The section `WHETHER AND HOW\nTO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE', below, gives instructions,\nexamples, and recommendations for authors who are considering\ndistributing their programs under this license.\n\nIn this license document, `The Program' refers to any program\ndistributed under this license.\n\nThis license gives conditions under which The Program may be distributed\nand conditions under which modified versions of The Program may be\ndistributed.  Individual files of The Program may bear supplementary\nand/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the\ndistribution of modified versions of themselves, but *no* file of The\nProgram may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the\ndistribution of an unmodified copy of the file.  A distributor wishing\nto distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program therefore\nneeds to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else.\n\nActivities other than distribution and/or modification of The Program\nare not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In\nparticular, the act of running The Program is not restricted.\n\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you\nthe freedom to make and distribute modified versions of The Program\nthat conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while\nmaintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of\nThe Program.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while \nmeeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'\nin the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\n\n\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n===========================================\n\nYou may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program.\nDistribution of only part of The Program is not allowed.\n\nYou may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal\nnotice forbidding modification of that file.\n\nYou may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the\nfollowing eight conditions are met:\n\n  1. You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the\n     distribution of a modified version of the file as described below\n     in the subsection `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of\n     The Program'.\n \n  2. If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any\n     applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified\n     version of the file that are described below in the subsection\n     `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files'.\n \n  3. You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the\n     original file.\n \n  4. In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and\n     name of the original file, and the name (if any) of the program\n     which contains it.\n \n  5. You must change any identification string in the file to indicate\n     clearly that the modified file is not part of The Program.\n \n  6. You must change any addresses in the modified file for the\n     reporting of errors in the file or in The Program generally to\n     ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original\n     maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified\n     files.\n \n  7. You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids\n     distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived\n     from the modified file with the filename of the original file.\n \n  8. You must do either (A) or (B):\n\n       (A) distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete,\n           unmodified copy of The Program) together with the modified\n           file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by\n           offering access to copy the modified file from a designated\n           place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program\n           from the same place meets this condition, even though third\n           parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the\n           modified file;\n\n       (B) provide to those who receive the modified file information\n           that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program;\n           for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)\n           for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of \n           The Program free of charge (either the version from which\n           your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version).\n\nNote that in the above, `distribution' of a file means making the\nfile available to others by any means.  This includes, for instance,\ninstalling the file on any machine in such a way that the file is\naccessible by users other than yourself.  `Modification' of a file\nmeans any procedure that produces a derivative file under any\napplicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or\na significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\nand/or translated into another language.\n\nChanging the name of a file (other than as necessitated by the file\nconventions of the target file systems) is considered to be a\nmodification of the file.\n\nThe distribution conditions in this license do not have to be\napplied to files that have been modified in accordance with the\nabove conditions.  Note, however, that Condition 7. does apply to\nany such modified file.\n\nThe conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not\napply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes\nidentical to the latest version of that file of The Program.\n\n \n\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own\npersonal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for\ndistributing the modified file.  While you might intend that such\nmodified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by\naccident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may\nnot occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file\nthat you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of\nthis license.  It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy\nof The Program identical with the public one.  Many programs provide\nways to control the behavior of that program without altering its\nlicensed files.\n\n\nAdditional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that\nsupplement and/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only\nif, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the\nfile or distribution of a modified version of the file.  The conditions\non individual files of The Program therefore may differ only with\nrespect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that\nis allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions\nof those files.\n\n\nAdditional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is,\nif it is a LaTeX software file), then the following additional\nconditions, which supplement and/or supersede the conditions\nabove, apply to the file according to its filename extension:\n\n  - You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins' since\n    these are installation files containing the legal notices that are\n    placed in the files they generate.\n \n  - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename\n    extension `.fd' (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard\n    conditions of the LPPL as described above.  You may also distribute\n    such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names\n    provided that:\n    (1) the only changes to the original files either enable use of\n        available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;\n    (2) you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input\n        paths can be used to control which set of LaTeX font definition\n        files is actually used by TeX).\n\n  - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename\n    extension `.cfg' (configuration files) with their original names.\n    The Program may (and usually will) specify the range of commands\n    that are allowed in a particular configuration file.\n \nBecause of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software,\nThe LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of\ncomponents of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them,\nbut such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.\n\n\nNO WARRANTY\n===========\n\nThere is no warranty for The Program.  Except when otherwise stated in\nwriting, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is', without\nwarranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not\nlimited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for\na particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance\nof The Program is with you.  Should The Program prove defective, you\nassume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\n\nIn no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or\nany author named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may\ndistribute and/or modify The Program as permitted above, be liable to\nyou for damages, including any general, special, incidental or\nconsequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of\ninability to use The Program (including, but not limited to, loss of\ndata, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as\na result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other\nprograms), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other\nparty has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE\n=========================================================\n\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and\nrecommendations for authors who are considering distributing their\nprograms under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in\nthis section.\n\n\nChoosing This License or Another License\n----------------------------------------\n\nIf for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution*\nconditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to\nthis license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your\nprogram under a different license.  You may use the text of this license\nas a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to\nthe LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your program is\ndistributed under the LPPL.\n\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains\nthe motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,\nfor example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public\nLicense (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your program is\nunrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be\nrelevant, and authors intending to distribute their programs under any\nlicense are encouraged to read it.\n\n\nHow to Use This License\n-----------------------\n\nTo use this license, place in each of the files of your program both\nan explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also\na statement that the distribution and/or modification of the file is\nconstrained by the conditions in this license.\n\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\n\n  %% pig.dtx\n  %% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name\n  %\n  % This program may be distributed and/or modified under the\n  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.2\n  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\n  % The latest version of this license is in\n  %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt\n  % and version 1.2 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX \n  % version 1999/12/01 or later.\n  %\n  % This program consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\n\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in\nthis license document would apply, with `The Program' referring to the\ntwo files `pig.dtx' and `pig.ins', and `The Copyright Holder' referring\nto the person `M. Y. Name'.\n\n\nImportant Recommendations\n-------------------------\n\n Defining What Constitutes The Program\n\n   The LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the\n   files of The Program.  It is therefore important that you provide a\n   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program.\n   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the\n   files of The Program near the copyright notice of each file or by\n   using a line like\n\n    % This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\n\n   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be\n   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you\n   to comprise The Program.\n\n Noting Exceptional Files\n  \n   If The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on\n   modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those\n   files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX\n   Software Files'), then it is recommended that The Program contain a\n   prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either\n   lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of\n   exceptional files.\n\n   Files containing the text of a license (such as this file) are\n   often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on\n   modification.  LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension\n   `.cfg') are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions\n   on the distribution of a modified version of the file.  The\n   additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples \n   of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional\n   conditions.\n",

REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form\nunder its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\n  b) its license agreement:\n\n    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n       warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n       warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n       implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n       for a particular purpose;\n\n    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all\n        liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n        incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement\n         are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other\n         party; and\n\n    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\n        reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for\n        software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\n  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\nwithin the Program.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\nContribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\nRecipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain\nresponsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the\nlike. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use\nof the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a\ncommercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not\ncreate potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a\nContributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,\nsuch Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend\nand indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\")\nagainst any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising\nfrom claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party\nagainst the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts\nor omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its\ndistribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The\nobligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\ninfringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)\npromptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,\nand b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with\nthe Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\nclaim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those\nperformance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\nContributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor\nmust pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\nPROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY\nWARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\nOR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely\nresponsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\ndistributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\nexercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to\nthe risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable\nlaws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and\nunavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\nANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\nINCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\nWITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\nLIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\nNEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR\nDISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED\nHEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nthe Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other\nsoftware or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such\nRecipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of\nthe date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably\npracticable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and\nany licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall\ncontinue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\nmay only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\nreserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\nthis Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\nSteward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\nis the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign\nthe responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable\nseparate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a\ndistinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)\nmay always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\nunder which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the\nAgreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the\nProgram (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as\nexpressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives\nno rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor\nunder this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or\notherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this\nAgreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and\nthe intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No\nparty to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement\nmore than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives\nits rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n",

It follows the same basic structure as this license, but\n  it is based on version 3 of the GNU GPL, and you can combine modules\n  released under GPLv3 and the GNU AGPLv3. If you were thinking about\n  releasing your software under this license, we recommend you use the\n  GNU AGPLv3 instead.\n\n  Additionally, in order to permit \"upgrading\" existing software\n  released under the Affero General Public License version 1 or later\n  as published by Affero, Inc. to GNU AGPLv3, Affero has published the\n  Affero General Public License version 2.\n\nAFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 1, March 2002\n\nCopyright Â© 2002 Affero Inc.\n510 Third Street - Suite 225, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA\n\nThis license is a modified version of the GNU General Public License\ncopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. made with\ntheir permission. Section 2(d) has been added to cover use of software\nover a computer network.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\nlicense document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\nto share and change it. By contrast, the Affero General Public License\nis intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This\nPublic License applies to most of Affero's software and to any other\nprogram whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Affero software\nis covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can\napply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. This General Public License is designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,\nwe want its recipients to know that what they have is not the\noriginal, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect\non the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at\nall.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this Affero General Public License. The \"Program\",\nbelow, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the\nProgram\" means either the Program or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\ninto another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\nlimitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as\n\"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\nis true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\nand disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\nthis License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\nrecipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the\nProgram.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\nit, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,\nprovided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n* a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n* b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n  whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\n  thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n  under the terms of this License.\n\n* c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n  when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n  interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n  announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n  that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n  warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n  conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n  License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n  not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the\n  Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\n* d) If the Program as you received it is intended to interact with\n  users through a computer network and if, in the version you\n  received, any user interacting with the Program was given the\n  opportunity to request transmission to that user of the Program's\n  complete source code, you must not remove that facility from your\n  modified version of the Program or work based on the Program, and\n  must offer an equivalent opportunity for all users interacting with\n  your Program through a computer network to request immediate\n  transmission by HTTP of the complete source code of your modified\n  version or other derivative work.\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n* a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n  and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;\n  or,\n\n* b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n  years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost\n  of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n  machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n  distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n  customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n* c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n  distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\n  only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\n  program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\n  accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\nto copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and\nwill automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,\nparties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\nherein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\nparties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices. Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. Affero Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the Affero\nGeneral Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be\nsimilar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nAffero, Inc. If the Program does not specify a version number of this\nLicense, you may choose any version ever published by Affero, Inc.\n\nYou may also choose to redistribute modified versions of this program\nunder any version of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public\nLicense version 3 or higher, so long as that version of the GNU GPL\nincludes terms and conditions substantially equivalent to those of\nthis license.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\nauthor to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by\nAffero, Inc., write to us; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE\nLAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\nAND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF\nANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nPROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nPROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n",

  "BitTorrentOSL1.1": " BitTorrent Open Source License\n\nVersion 1.1\n\nThis BitTorrent Open Source License (the \"License\") applies to the\nBitTorrent client and related software products as well as any updates\nor maintenance releases of that software (\"BitTorrent Products\") that\nare distributed by BitTorrent, Inc. (\"Licensor\"). Any BitTorrent\nProduct licensed pursuant to this License is a Licensed\nProduct. Licensed Product, in its entirety, is protected by\nU.S. copyright law. This License identifies the terms under which you\nmay use, copy, distribute or modify Licensed Product.\n\nPreamble\n\nThis Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature\nand scope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of\nthis license. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon\nthe terms of the License and not this Preamble.\n\nThis License complies with the Open Source Definition and is derived\nfrom the Jabber Open Source License 1.0 (the \"JOSL\"), which has been\napproved by Open Source Initiative. Sections 4(c) and 4(f)(iii) from\nthe JOSL have been deleted.\n\nThis License provides that:\n\n1. You may use or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as a\ncomponent of an aggregate software distribution containing programs\nfrom several different sources. No royalty or other fee is required.\n\n2. Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product,\nincluding Modifications made by previous Contributors, are available\nfor your use. (The terms \"Licensed Product,\" \"Modifications,\"\n\"Contributors\" and \"Source Code\" are defined in the License.)\n\n3. You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and\nyou can create Derivative Works from it. (The term \"Derivative Works\"\nis defined in the License.)\n\n4. By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this\nLicense, you agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed\nProduct and then distribute are governed by the provisions of this\nLicense. In particular, you must make the Source Code of your\nModifications available to others free of charge and without a\nroyalty.\n\n5. You may sell, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation\nfor executable versions of a Licensed Product, without paying a\nroyalty or other fee to the Licensor or any Contributor, provided that\nsuch executable versions contain your or another Contributor?s\nmaterial Modifications. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent your\nexecutable version of a Licensed Product does not contain your or\nanother Contributor?s material Modifications, you may not sell, accept\ndonations or otherwise receive compensation for such executable.\n\nYou may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the Licensor is\nnot providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor\naccepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Product doesn't\nwork properly or causes you any injury or damages.\n\n6. If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you may\ncharge fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or\nliability obligations to your customers. You cannot charge for, sell,\naccept donations or otherwise receive compensation for the Source\nCode.\n\n7. If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to\nthe Licensed Product, or if you breach any terms of the License, your\nrights to the Licensed Product under this License automatically\nterminate.\n\nYou may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in\nwhich case the provisions of this License will apply to your\nDerivative Works just as they do to the original Licensed Product.\n\nAlternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any\nother OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license\nof your choice. If you use any license other than this License,\nhowever, you must continue to fulfill the requirements of this License\n(including the provisions relating to publishing the Source Code) for\nthose portions of your Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed\nProduct, including the files containing Modifications.\n\nNew versions of this License may be published from time to time in\nconnection with new versions of a Licensed Product or otherwise. You\nmay choose to continue to use the license terms in this version of the\nLicense for the Licensed Product that was originally licensed\nhereunder, however, the new versions of this License will at all times\napply to new versions of the Licensed Product released by Licensor\nafter the release of the new version of this License. Only the\nLicensor has the right to change the License terms as they apply to\nthe Licensed Product.\n\nThis License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those\nterms are defined when they are first used, and the definitions are\nrepeated for your convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.\n\nLicense Terms\n\n1. Grant of License From Licensor. Subject to the terms and conditions\nof this License, Licensor hereby grants you a world-wide,\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party\nintellectual property claims, to do the following:\n\na.

Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by\nContributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or\notherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to\nthe extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make,\nuse, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of\nModifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.\n\n2. Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor. \"Modifications\"\nmeans any additions to or deletions from the substance or structure of\n(i) a file containing a Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file that\ncontains any part of a Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this License,\nthe term \"Licensed Product\" shall include all previous Modifications\nthat you receive from any Contributor. Subject to the terms and\nconditions of this License, By application of the provisions in\nSection 4(a) below, each person or entity who created or contributed\nto the creation of, and distributed, a Modification (a \"Contributor\")\nhereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license,\nsubject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the\nfollowing:\n\na. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute\nany Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in\nboth Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified\nbasis or as part of Derivative Works.\n\nb. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by\nContributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or\notherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to\nthe extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make,\nuse, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of\nModifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.\n\n3. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be\ndeemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade\nsecrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any\nContributor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is\ngranted separate from the Licensed Product, for code that you delete\nfrom the Licensed Product, or for combinations of the Licensed Product\nwith other software or hardware. No right is granted to the trademarks\nof Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the\nLicensed Product. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to\nprohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this\nLicense any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to\nlicense. As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product,\nyou hereby agree that you will not, without the prior written consent\nof Licensor, use any trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or\nany other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except\nas expressly stated herein. For the avoidance of doubt and without\nlimiting the foregoing, you hereby agree that you will not use or\ndisplay any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor in any domain\nname, directory filepath, advertisement, link or other reference to\nyou in any manner or in any media.\n\n4. Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.\n\na. Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an express\ncondition for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that\nany Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and\nwhich you distribute, are governed by the terms of this License\nincluding, without limitation, Section 2. Any Modifications that you\ncreate or to which you contribute may be distributed only under the\nterms of this License or a future version of this License released\nunder Section 7. You must include a copy of this License with every\ncopy of the Modifications you distribute. You agree not to offer or\nimpose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the\nLicensed Product or Modifications that alter or restrict the\napplicable version of this License or the recipients' rights\nhereunder. However, you may include an additional document offering\nthe additional rights described in Section 4(d).\n\nb. Availability of Source Code. You must make available, without\ncharge, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the\nLicensed Product and any Modifications that you distribute, either on\nthe same media as you distribute any executable or other form of the\nLicensed Product, or via a mechanism generally accepted in the\nsoftware development community for the electronic transfer of data (an\n\"Electronic Distribution Mechanism\"). The Source Code for any version\nof Licensed Product or Modifications that you distribute must remain\navailable for as long as any executable or other form of the Licensed\nProduct is distributed by you. You are responsible for ensuring that\nthe Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic\nDistribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\nc. Intellectual Property Matters.\n\ni. Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to a third\nparty's intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights\ngranted by this License, you must include a text file with the Source\nCode distribution titled \"LEGAL\" that describes the claim and the\nparty making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know\nwhom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any\nModifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall\npromptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available\nthereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate\nmailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who\nreceived the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge has been\nobtained.\n\nii. Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application\nprogramming interface (\"API\") and you have knowledge of patent\nlicenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must\nalso include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\niii. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant\nto 4(c)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications you distribute\nare your original creations and that you have sufficient rights to\ngrant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\nd. Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any\ndocumentation you provide along with the Source Code of any\nModifications you create or to which you contribute, and which you\ndistribute, wherever you describe recipients' rights relating to\nLicensed Product. You must duplicate the notice contained in Exhibit A\n(the \"Notice\") in each file of the Source Code of any copy you\ndistribute of the Licensed Product. If you created a Modification, you\nmay add your name as a Contributor to the Notice. If it is not\npossible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its\nstructure, then you must include such Notice in a location (such as a\nrelevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such\na notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients\nof Licensed Product. However, you may do so only on your own behalf,\nand not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it\nclear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability\nobligation is offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify\nthe Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\nLicensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms you offer.\n\ne. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Licensed\nProduct as an executable program under a license of your choice that\nmay contain terms different from this License provided (i) you have\nsatisfied the requirements of Sections 4(a) through 4(d) for that\ndistribution, (ii) you include a conspicuous notice in the executable\nversion, related documentation and collateral materials stating that\nthe Source Code version of the Licensed Product is available under the\nterms of this License, including a description of how and where you\nhave fulfilled the obligations of Section 4(b), and (iii) you make it\nclear that any terms that differ from this License are offered by you\nalone, not by Licensor or any Contributor. You hereby agree to\nindemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability\nincurred by Licensor or such Contributor as a result of any terms you\noffer.\n\nf. Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create Derivative Works\n(e.g., combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product with other\ncode) and distribute the Derivative Works as products under any other\nlicense you select, with the proviso that the requirements of this\nLicense are fulfilled for those portions of the Derivative Works that\nconsist of the Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto.\n\ng. Compensation for Distribution of Executable Versions of Licensed\nProducts, Modifications or Derivative Works. Notwithstanding any\nprovision of this License to the contrary, by distributing, selling,\nlicensing, sublicensing or otherwise making available any Licensed\nProduct, or Modification or Derivative Work thereof, you and Licensor\nhereby acknowledge and agree that you may sell, license or sublicense\nfor a fee, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for\nexecutable versions of a Licensed Product, without paying a royalty or\nother fee to the Licensor or any other Contributor, provided that such\nexecutable versions (i) contain your or another Contributor?s material\nModifications, or (ii) are otherwise material Derivative Works. For\npurposes of this License, an executable version of the Licensed\nProduct will be deemed to contain a material Modification, or will\notherwise be deemed a material Derivative Work, if (a) the Licensed\nProduct is modified with your own or a third party?s software programs\nor other code, and/or the Licensed Product is combined with a number\nof your own or a third party?s software programs or code,\nrespectively, and (b) such software programs or code add or contribute\nmaterial value, functionality or features to the License Product. For\nthe avoidance of doubt, to the extent your executable version of a\nLicensed Product does not contain your or another Contributor?s\nmaterial Modifications or is otherwise not a material Derivative Work,\nin each case as contemplated herein, you may not sell, license or\nsublicense for a fee, accept donations or otherwise receive\ncompensation for such executable. Additionally, without limitation of\nthe foregoing and notwithstanding any provision of this License to the\ncontrary, you cannot charge for, sell, license or sublicense for a\nfee, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for the Source\nCode.\n\n5. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is\nimpossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this License\nwith respect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to statute,\njudicial order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms\nof this License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute\nor regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the License, and\n(iii) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such\ndescription must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section\n4(d), and must be included with all distributions of the Source\nCode. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such\ndescription must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary\nskill at computer programming to be able to understand it.\n\n6. Application of This License. This License applies to code to which\nLicensor or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A, which is\nincorporated herein by this reference.\n\n7. Versions of This License.\n\na. New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or\nnew versions of the License.\n\nb. Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published\nunder a particular version of the License, you may always continue to\nuse it under the terms of that version, provided that any such license\nbe in full force and effect at the time, and has not been revoked or\notherwise terminated. You may also choose to use such Licensed Product\nunder the terms of any subsequent version (but not any prior version)\nof the License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has\nthe right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Product created\nunder this License.\n\nc. Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified\nversion of this License, which you may do only in order to apply it to\nsoftware that is not already a Licensed Product under this License,\nyou must rename your license so that it is not confusingly similar to\nthis License, and must make it clear that your license contains terms\nthat differ from this License. In so naming your license, you may not\nuse any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor.\n\n8. Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS\nLICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE\nLICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE\nQUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD\nLICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE\nLICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY\nSERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY\nCONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED\nPRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n9. Termination.\n\na. Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights\ngranted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply\nwith the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within ten (10)\ndays of being notified of the breach by the Licensor. For purposes of\nthis provision, proof of delivery via email to the address listed in\nthe ?WHOIS? database of the registrar for any website through which\nyou distribute or market any Licensed Product, or to any alternate\nemail address which you designate in writing to the Licensor, shall\nconstitute sufficient notification. All sublicenses to the Licensed\nProduct that are properly granted shall survive any termination of\nthis license so long as they continue to complye with the terms of\nthis License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect\nbeyond the termination of this License, shall survive.\n\nb. Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you initiate\nlitigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding\ndeclaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor\n(Licensor or Contributor against whom you file such an action is\nreferred to herein as Respondent) alleging that Licensed Product\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights\ngranted by such Respondent to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this\nLicense shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from\nRespondent (the \"Notice Period\") unless within that Notice Period you\neither agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable\nreasonably royalty for your past or future use of Licensed Product\nmade by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with\nrespect to Licensed Product against such Respondent. If within said\nNotice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\nmutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\nis not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under Sections\n1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice\nPeriod.\n\nc. Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent\ninfringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Product\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is\nresolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of\npatent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the\nlicenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be\ntaken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment\nor license.\n\nd. No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination\nunder Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license agreements\n(excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been\nvalidly granted by you or any distributor hereunder prior to\ntermination shall survive termination.\n\n10. Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL\nTHEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE,\nSHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED\nPRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY\nPERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\nOF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF\nGOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND\nALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE\nBEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\nLIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\nRESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\nPROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\nEXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\nTHIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n11. Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors,\neach party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or\nindirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License. You\nagree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such\nresponsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\nshall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n12. U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Product is a commercial\nitem, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995),\nconsisting of commercial computer software and commercial computer\nsoftware documentation, as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212\n(Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48\nC.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government\nEnd Users acquire Licensed Product with only those rights set forth\nherein.\n\n13. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement\nconcerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License\nis held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to\nthe extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be\ngoverned by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable\nlaw, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law\nprovisions. You expressly agree that in any litigation relating to\nthis license the losing party shall be responsible for costs\nincluding, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys\nfees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\nContracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly\nexcluded. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a\ncontract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to\nthis License.\n\n14. Definition of You in This License. You throughout this License,\nwhether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity\nexercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this\nLicense or a future version of this License issued under Section\n7. For legal entities, you includes any entity that controls, is\ncontrolled by, is under common control with, or affiliated with,\nyou. For purposes of this definition, control means (i) the power,\ndirect or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such\nentity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty\npercent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial\nownership of such entity.

(You will not be required to justify\n    it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at\n    large as a market that must bear the fee.)\n\n    \"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item\n    itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It\n    also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under\n    the same conditions they received it.\n\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of\n   the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided\n   that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and\n   associated disclaimers.\n\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications\n   derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A\n   Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the\n   Standard Version.\n\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,\n   provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file\n   stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you\n   do at least ONE of the following:\n\n    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make\n       them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to\n       Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on\n       a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the\n       Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard\n       Version of the Package.\n\n    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n\n    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not\n       conflict with standard executables, which must also be\n       provided, and provide a separate manual page for each\n       non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs\n       from the Standard Version.\n\n    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or\nexecutable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library\n       files, together with instructions (in the manual page or\n       equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.\n\n    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of\n       the Package with your modifications.\n\n    c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding\n       Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard\n       executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the\n       differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with\n       instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n\n    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n5.

If You created one or more Modification(s) \n\tYou may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in \n\tExhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation \n\tfor the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership \n\trights relating to Covered Code.

Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n\tYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the \n\trequirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, \n\tand if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of \n\tthe Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, \n\tincluding a description of how and where You have fulfilled the \n\tobligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included \n\tin any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or \n\tcollateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the \n\tCovered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered \n\tCode or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may \n\tcontain terms different from this License, provided that You are in \n\tcompliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the \n\tExecutable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's \n\trights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this \n\tLicense. If You distribute the Executable version under a different \n\tlicense You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ \n\tfrom this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial \n\tDeveloper or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the \n\tInitial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by \n\tthe Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such \n\tterms You offer. \n\n3.7.

Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. \n\n\tIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this \n\tLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to \n\tstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with \n\tthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) \n\tdescribe the limitations and the code they affect.

Versions of the License. \n\n6.1. New Versions.\n\n\tSun Microsystems, Inc. (\"Sun\") may publish revised and/or new versions \n\tof the License from time to time. Each version will be given a \n\tdistinguishing version number. \n\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n\tOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the \n\tLicense, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that \n\tversion. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms \n\tof any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one \n\tother than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered \n\tCode created under this License. \n\n6.3. Derivative Works.\n\n\tIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may \n\tonly do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code \n\tgoverned by this License), You must: (a) rename Your license so that \n\tthe phrases \"Sun,\" \"Sun Public License,\" or \"SPL\" or any confusingly \n\tsimilar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your \n\tlicense differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear \n\tthat Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the \n\tSun Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, \n\tOriginal Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A \n\tshall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this \n\tLicense.)\n\n7.

In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all \n\tend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) \n\twhich have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder \n\tprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. \n\n\tUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT \n\t(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL \n\tDEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, \n\tOR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR \n\tANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY \n\tCHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, \n\tWORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER \n\tCOMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN \n\tINFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF \n\tLIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY \n\tRESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW \n\tPROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE \n\tEXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO \n\tTHIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. \n\n\tThe Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48 \n\tC.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" \n\tand \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such terms are \n\tused in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. \n\t12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all \n\tU.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights \n\tset forth herein.\n\n11.

  "Free-Art-L-v1.3": " Free Art License 1.3\n\n\n[ Copyleft Attitude ]\n\nFree Art License 1.3 (FAL 1.3)\n\nPreamble\n\nThe Free Art License grants the right to freely copy, distribute, and\ntransform creative works without infringing the author's rights.\n\nThe Free Art License recognizes and protects these rights. Their\nimplementation has been reformulated in order to allow everyone to use\ncreations of the human mind in a creative manner, regardless of their\ntypes and ways of expression.\n\nWhile the public's access to creations of the human mind usually is\nrestricted by the implementation of copyright law, it is favoured by\nthe Free Art License. This license intends to allow the use of a\nworkâ€™s resources; to establish new conditions for creating in order to\nincrease creation opportunities. The Free Art License grants the right\nto use a work, and acknowledges the right holderâ€™s and the userâ€™s\nrights and responsibility.\n\nThe invention and development of digital technologies, Internet and\nFree Software have changed creation methods: creations of the human\nmind can obviously be distributed, exchanged, and transformed. They\nallow to produce common works to which everyone can contribute to the\nbenefit of all.\n\nThe main rationale for this Free Art License is to promote and protect\nthese creations of the human mind according to the principles of\ncopyleft: freedom to use, copy, distribute, transform, and prohibition\nof exclusive appropriation.\n\nDefinitions\n\nâ€œworkâ€� either means the initial work, the subsequent works or the\ncommon work as defined hereafter:\n\nâ€œcommon workâ€� means a work composed of the initial work and all\nsubsequent contributions to it (originals and copies). The initial\nauthor is the one who, by choosing this license, defines the\nconditions under which contributions are made.\n\nâ€œInitial workâ€� means the work created by the initiator of the common\nwork (as defined above), the copies of which can be modified by\nwhoever wants to\n\nâ€œSubsequent worksâ€� means the contributions made by authors who\nparticipate in the evolution of the common work by exercising the\nrights to reproduce, distribute, and modify that are granted by the\nlicense.\n\nâ€œOriginalsâ€� (sources or resources of the work) means all copies of\neither the initial work or any subsequent work mentioning a date and\nused by their author(s) as references for any subsequent updates,\ninterpretations, copies or reproductions.\n\nâ€œCopyâ€� means any reproduction of an original as defined by this\nlicense.\n\n1. OBJECT\n\nThe aim of this license is to define the conditions under which one\ncan use this work freely.\n\n2. SCOPE\n\nThis work is subject to copyright law. Through this license its author\nspecifies the extent to which you can copy, distribute, and modify it.\n\n2.1 FREEDOM TO COPY (OR TO MAKE REPRODUCTIONS)\n\nYou have the right to copy this work for yourself, your friends or any\nother person, whatever the technique used.\n\n2.2 FREEDOM TO DISTRIBUTE, TO PERFORM IN PUBLIC\n\nYou have the right to distribute copies of this work; whether modified\nor not, whatever the medium and the place, with or without any charge,\nprovided that you: attach this license without any modification to the\ncopies of this work or indicate precisely where the license can be\nfound, specify to the recipient the names of the author(s) of the\noriginals, including yours if you have modified the work, specify to\nthe recipient where to access the originals (either initial or\nsubsequent).\n\nThe authors of the originals may, if they wish to, give you the right\nto distribute the originals under the same conditions as the copies.\n\n2.3 FREEDOM TO MODIFY\n\nYou have the right to modify copies of the originals (whether initial\nor subsequent) provided you comply with the following conditions: all\nconditions in article 2.2 above, if you distribute modified copies;\nindicate that the work has been modified and, if it is possible, what\nkind of modifications have been made; distribute the subsequent work\nunder the same license or any compatible license.\n\nThe author(s) of the original work may give you the right to modify it\nunder the same conditions as the copies.\n\n3. RELATED RIGHTS\n\nActivities giving rise to authorâ€™s rights and related rights shall not\nchallenge the rights granted by this license.\n\nFor example, this is the reason why performances must be subject to\nthe same license or a compatible license. Similarly, integrating the\nwork in a database, a compilation or an anthology shall not prevent\nanyone from using the work under the same conditions as those defined\nin this license.\n\n4. INCORPORATION OF THE WORK\n\nIncorporating this work into a larger work that is not subject to the\nFree Art License shall not challenge the rights granted by this\nlicense.\n\nIf the work can no longer be accessed apart from the larger work in\nwhich it is incorporated, then incorporation shall only be allowed\nunder the condition that the larger work is subject either to the Free\nArt License or a compatible license.\n\n5. COMPATIBILITY\n\nA license is compatible with the Free Art License provided: it gives\nthe right to copy, distribute, and modify copies of the work including\nfor commercial purposes and without any other restrictions than those\nrequired by the respect of the other compatibility criteria; it\nensures proper attribution of the work to its authors and access to\nprevious versions of the work when possible; it recognizes the Free\nArt License as compatible (reciprocity); it requires that changes made\nto the work be subject to the same license or to a license which also\nmeets these compatibility criteria.\n\n6. YOUR INTELLECTUAL RIGHTS\n\nThis license does not aim at denying your author's rights in your\ncontribution or any related right. By choosing to contribute to the\ndevelopment of this common work, you only agree to grant others the\nsame rights with regard to your contribution as those you were granted\nby this license. Conferring these rights does not mean you have to\ngive up your intellectual rights.\n\n7. YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nThe freedom to use the work as defined by the Free Art License (right\nto copy, distribute, modify) implies that everyone is responsible for\ntheir own actions.\n\n8. DURATION OF THE LICENSE\n\nThis license takes effect as of your acceptance of its terms. The act\nof copying, distributing, or modifying the work constitutes a tacit\nagreement. This license will remain in effect for as long as the\ncopyright which is attached to the work. If you do not respect the\nterms of this license, you automatically lose the rights that it\nconfers.\n\nIf the legal status or legislation to which you are subject makes it\nimpossible for you to respect the terms of this license, you may not\nmake use of the rights which it confers.\n\n9. VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE\n\nThis license may undergo periodic modifications to incorporate\nimprovements by its authors (instigators of the â€œCopyleft Attitudeâ€�\nmovement) by way of new, numbered versions.\n\nYou will always have the choice of accepting the terms contained in\nthe version under which the copy of the work was distributed to you,\nor alternatively, to use the provisions of one of the subsequent\nversions.\n\n10. SUB-LICENSING\n\nSub-licenses are not authorized by this license. Any person wishing to\nmake use of the rights that it confers will be directly bound to the\nauthors of the common work.\n\n11. LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\nThis license is written with respect to both French law and the Berne\nConvention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.\n\nUSER GUIDE\n\n- How to use the Free Art License?\n\nTo benefit from the Free Art License, you only need to mention the\nfollowing elements on your work:\n\n  [Name of the author, title, date of the work. When applicable, names\n  of authors of the common work and, if possible, where to find the\n  originals].\n\nCopyleft: This is a free work, you can copy, distribute, and modify it\nunder the terms of the Free Art License\nhttp://artlibre.org/licence/lal/en/\n\n- Why to use the Free Art License?\n\n  1.To give the greatest number of people access to your work.\n\n  2.To allow it to be distributed freely.\n\n  3.To allow it to evolve by allowing its copy, distribution, and\n    transformation by others.\n\n  4.So that you benefit from the resources of a work when it is under\n    the Free Art License: to be able to copy, distribute or transform\n    it freely.\n\n  5.But also, because the Free Art License offers a legal framework to\n    disallow any misappropriation. It is forbidden to take hold of\n    your work and bypass the creative process for one's exclusive\n    possession.\n\n\n- When to use the Free Art License?\n\nAny time you want to benefit and make others benefit from the right to\ncopy, distribute and transform creative works without any exclusive\nappropriation, you should use the Free Art License.

You can choose to apply the Free Art License on any text,\npicture, sound, gesture, or whatever sort of stuff on which you have\nsufficient author's rights.\n\n- Historical background of this license:\n\nIt is the result of observing, using and creating digital\ntechnologies, free software, the Internet and art. It arose from the\nâ€œCopyleft Attitudeâ€� meetings which took place in Paris in 2000. For\nthe first time, these meetings brought together members of the Free\nSoftware community, artists, and members of the art world. The goal\nwas to adapt the principles of Copyleft and free software to all sorts\nof creations. http://www.artlibre.org\n\nCopyleft Attitude, 2007.\n\nYou can make reproductions and distribute this license verbatim\n(without any changes).\n\n    Translation : Jonathan Clarke, Benjamin Jean, Griselda Jung, Fanny\n    Mourguet, Antoine Pitrou.

This license includes the non-exclusive license and right to use\n(i) the RIFT SDK to make applications, content, games and demos\n(collectively and generally referred to as â€œDeveloper Contentâ€�) that run\non the Oculus VR approved mobile hardware and software products (â€œOculus\nApproved Rift Productsâ€�) and which may incorporate the RIFT SDK in whole\nor in part in binary or object code; and (ii) to use the RIFT SDK to\ncreate derivative works of the RIFT SDK itself (\"RIFT SDK Derivatives\"),\nwhether in source, binary, or object form, in whole or in part,\nincluding third party software unless otherwise noted.\n\n1.2.

  "Python1.6a2": " Python Copyright\n\nHistorical note: This page describes the Python license used for\nPython versions up to and including Python 1.6a2. CNRI released Python\n1.6b1 and the final Python 1.6 release under a different license,\nwhich is open source compliant, but not compatible with the GPL (the\nonly incompatibility being the inclusion of a choice-of-law\nclause). More recent PSF releases, in particular 2.0.1, 2.1.1, and all\nreleases since then, are GPL-compatible.  Most Python sources and\nbinaries are distributed under the following copyright. A few files\nhave a different copyright owner, but otherwise the notice is similar.\n\n\n  *\"final Python 1.6\" above links to:\n  http://web.archive.org/web/20070208215509/http://www.python.org/download/releases/1.6/\n\n  *\"PSF\" above links to:\n  http://web.archive.org/web/20070202204117/http://www.python.org/psf/\n  \n  *\"2.0.1, 2.1.1, and all releases since then\" links to:\n  http://web.archive.org/web/20070202023003/http://www.python.org/download/\n\n\nThe gist of it is that Python is absolutely free, even for commercial\nuse (including resale). There is no GNU-like \"copyleft\" restriction.\n\nA clarification: some very picky lawyers are worried that the notice\ndoesn't explicitly grant permission to distribute modified copies\n(even though it grants permission to copy, modify, and\ndistribute). This can be considered an oversight in the notice; we\nhave no intention to limit distribution of modified copies (that\notherwise play by the rules). Similarly, the words \"without fee\" are\nto be read connected to \"permission\": permission is granted without\nfee. We are in the process of revising the notice to clarify it, but\nthis is a slow process.\n\nAnother clarification: the limitation of the copyright to 1991-1995 in\nthe notice is not a mistake, but rather a deliberate\ndecision. Copyright applies regardless of whether it is explicitly\nstated or not.\n\nNews: The Open Source Initiative board has voted to certify the Python\nlicense as Open Source.\n\n  *\"Open Source Initiative\" above links to: \n  http://web.archive.org/web/20061128020422/http://www.opensource.org/\n\nAnd if you had to ask, yes, this license is compatible with the GPL (sez RMS).\n\n  *\"GPL\" above links to:\n  http://web.archive.org/web/20070202181626/http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html\n  \n  *\"RMS\" above links to:\n  http://web.archive.org/web/20070202204117/http://www.stallman.org/\n\nCopyright 1991-1995 by Stichting Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam, The\nNetherlands.\n\nAll Rights Reserved Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute\nthis software and its documentation for any purpose and without fee is\nhereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice appear in all\ncopies and that both that copyright notice and this permission notice\nappear in supporting documentation, and that the names of Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum or CWI or Corporation for National Research\nInitiatives or CNRI not be used in advertising or publicity pertaining\nto distribution of the software without specific, written prior\npermission.\n\nWhile CWI is the initial source for this software, a modified version\nis made available by the Corporation for National Research Initiatives\n(CNRI) at the Internet address http://www.python.org.\n\nSTICHTING MATHEMATISCH CENTRUM AND CNRI DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES WITH\nREGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS, IN NO EVENT SHALL STICHTING MATHEMATISCH\nCENTRUM OR CNRI BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL\nDAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA OR\nPROFITS, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER\nTORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR\nPERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.\n",

However, this Preamble is not a part of\nthis license. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon\nthe terms of the License and not this Preamble. This License complies\nwith the Open Source Definition and has been approved by Open Source\nInitiative. Software distributed under this License may be marked as\n\"OSI Certified Open Source Software.\"\n\nThis License provides that:\n\n   1. You may use, sell or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as\n   a component of an aggregate software distribution containing\n   programs from several different sources. No royalty or other fee is\n   required.\n\n   2. Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed\n   Product, including Modifications made by previous Contributors, are\n   available for your use. (The terms \"Licensed Product,\"\n   \"Modifications,\" \"Contributors\" and \"Source Code\" are defined in\n   the License.)\n\n   3. You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product,\n   and you can create Derivative Works from it. (The term \"Derivative\n   Works\" is defined in the License.)\n\n   4. By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this\n   License, you agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed\n   Product and then distribute are governed by the provisions of this\n   License. In particular, you must make the Source Code of your\n   Modifications available to others.\n\n   5. You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the\n   Licensor is not providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the\n   Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed\n   Product doesn't work properly or causes you any injury or damages.\n\n   6. If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you\n   may charge fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity\n   or liability obligations to your customers. You cannot charge for\n   the Source Code.\n\n   7. If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to\n   the Licensed Product, or if you breach any terms of the License,\n   your rights to the Licensed Product under this License\n   automatically terminate.\n\n   You may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works,\n   in which case the provisions of this License will apply to your\n   Derivative Works just as they do to the original Licensed Product.\n\n   Alternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any\n   other OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary\n   license of your choice. If you use any license other than this\n   License, however, you must continue to fulfill the requirements of\n   this License (including the provisions relating to publishing the\n   Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that\n   consist of the Licensed Product, including the files containing\n   Modifications.\n\n   New versions of this License may be published from time to\n   time. You may choose to continue to use the license terms in this\n   version of the License or those from the new version. However, only\n   the Licensor has the right to change the License terms as they\n   apply to the Licensed Product. This License relies on precise\n   definitions for certain terms. Those terms are defined when they\n   are first used, and the definitions are repeated for your\n   convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.\n\nLicense Terms\n\n   1. Grant of License From Licensor. Licensor hereby grants you a\n   world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third\n   party intellectual property claims, to do the following:\n\n     a. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and\n     distribute Licensed Product or portions thereof (including\n     Modifications as hereinafter defined), in both Source Code or as\n     an executable program. \"Source Code\" means the preferred form for\n     making modifications to the Licensed Product, including all\n     modules contained therein, plus any associated interface\n     definition files, scripts used to control compilation and\n     installation of an executable program, or a list of differential\n     comparisons against the Source Code of the Licensed Product.\n\n     b. Create Derivative Works (as that term is defined under\n     U.S. copyright law) of Licensed Product by adding to or deleting\n     from the substance or structure of said Licensed Product.\n\n     c. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled\n     by Licensor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,\n     and/or otherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions thereof,\n     but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to\n     enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or\n     otherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions thereof or\n     Derivative Works thereof.\n\n   2. Grant of License to Modifications From\n   Contributor. \"Modifications\" means any additions to or deletions\n   from the substance or structure of (i) a file containing Licensed\n   Product, or (ii) any new file that contains any part of Licensed\n   Product. Hereinafter in this License, the term \"Licensed Product\"\n   shall include all previous Modifications that you receive from any\n   Contributor. By application of the provisions in Section 4(a)\n   below, each person or entity who created or contributed to the\n   creation of, and distributed, a Modification (a \"Contributor\")\n   hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive\n   license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do\n   the following:\n\n     a. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and\n     distribute any Modifications created by such Contributor or\n     portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable\n     program, either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative\n     Works.\n\n     b. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled\n     by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,\n     and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof,\n     but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to\n     enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or\n     otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or\n     Derivative Works thereof.\n\n   3. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be\n   deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents,\n   trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any\n   Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is\n   granted separate from the Licensed Product, for code that you\n   delete from the Licensed Product, or for combinations of the\n   Licensed Product with other software or hardware. No right is\n   granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if\n   such marks are included in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this\n   License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing\n   under different terms from this License any code that Licensor\n   otherwise would have a right to license.\n\n   4. Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.\n      \n     a. Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an\n     express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you\n     hereby agree that any Modifications that you create or to which\n     you contribute, and which you distribute, are governed by the\n     terms of this License including, without limitation, Section\n     2. Any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute\n     may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a\n     future version of this License released under Section 7. You must\n     include a copy of this License with every copy of the\n     Modifications you distribute. You agree not to offer or impose\n     any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the\n     Licensed Product or Modifications that alter or restrict the\n     applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights\n     hereunder. However, you may include an additional document\n     offering the additional rights described in Section 4(e).\n\n     b. Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under\n     the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed\n     Product and any Modifications that you distribute, either on the\n     same media as you distribute any executable or other form of the\n     Licensed Product, or via a mechanism generally accepted in the\n     software development community for the electronic transfer of\n     data (an \"Electronic Distribution Mechanism\"). The Source Code\n     for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that you\n     distribute must remain available for at least twelve (12) months\n     after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)\n     months after a subsequent version of said Licensed Product or\n     Modifications has been made available. You are responsible for\n     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if\n     the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third\n     party.\n\n     c. Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications\n     that you create or to which you contribute, and which you\n     distribute, to contain a file documenting the additions, changes\n     or deletions you made to create or contribute to those\n     Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or\n     deletions. You must include a prominent statement that the\n     Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the\n     Licensed Product and include the names of the Licensor and any\n     Contributor to the Licensed Product in (i) the Source Code and\n     (ii) in any notice displayed by a version of the Licensed Product\n     you distribute or in related documentation in which you describe\n     the origin or ownership of the Licensed Product. You may not\n     modify or delete any preexisting copyright notices in the\n     Licensed Product.\n\n     d. Intellectual Property Matters.\n\n       i. Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to\n       a third party's intellectual property right is required to\n       exercise the rights granted by this License, you must include a\n       text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" that\n       describes the claim and the party making the claim in\n       sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to\n       contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any\n       Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall\n       promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available\n       thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying\n       appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated\n       to inform those who received the Licensed Product from you that\n       new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n       ii. Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an\n       application programming interface (\"API\") and you have\n       knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to\n       implement that API, you must also include this information in\n       the LEGAL file.\n\n       iii. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed\n       pursuant to 4(d)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications\n       you distribute are your original creations and that you have\n       sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n     e. Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any\n     documentation you provide along with the Source Code of any\n     Modifications you create or to which you contribute, and which\n     you distribute, wherever you describe recipients' rights relating\n     to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the notice contained in\n     Exhibit A (the \"Notice\") in each file of the Source Code of any\n     copy you distribute of the Licensed Product. If you created a\n     Modification, you may add your name as a Contributor to the\n     Notice. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular\n     Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such\n     Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a\n     user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to\n     offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or\n     liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed\n     Product. However, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not\n     on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it\n     clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n     obligation is offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to\n     indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability\n     incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of\n     warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer.\n\n     f. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute\n     Licensed Product as an executable program under a license of your\n     choice that may contain terms different from this License\n     provided (i) you have satisfied the requirements of Sections 4(a)\n     through 4(e) for that distribution, (ii) you include a\n     conspicuous notice in the executable version, related\n     documentation and collateral materials stating that the Source\n     Code version of the Licensed Product is available under the terms\n     of this License, including a description of how and where you\n     have fulfilled the obligations of Section 4(b), (iii) you retain\n     all existing copyright notices in the Licensed Product, and (iv)\n     you make it clear that any terms that differ from this License\n     are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or any Contributor. You\n     hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for\n     any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as a\n     result of any terms you offer.\n\n     g. Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create Derivative\n     Works (e.g., combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product\n     with other code) and distribute the Derivative Works as products\n     under any other license you select, with the proviso that the\n     requirements of this License are fulfilled for those portions of\n     the Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product or any\n     Modifications thereto.\n\n   5. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is\n   impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this License\n   with respect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to statute,\n   judicial order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the\n   terms of this License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the\n   statute or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the\n   License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the code they\n   affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file\n   described in Section 4(d), and must be included with all\n   distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited\n   by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently\n   detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill at computer programming\n   to be able to understand it.\n\n   6. Application of This License. This License applies to code to\n   which Licensor or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A,\n   which is incorporated herein by this reference.\n\n   7. Versions of This License.\n\n     a. New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised\n     and/or new versions of the License.\n\n     b. Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been\n     published under a particular version of the License, you may\n     always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You\n     may also choose to use such Licensed Product under the terms of\n     any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No\n     one other than Lic ensor has the right to modify the terms\n     applicable to Licensed Product created under this License.\n\n     c. Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a\n     modified version of this License, which you may do only in order\n     to apply it to software that is not already a Licensed Product\n     under this License, you must rename your license so that it is\n     not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear\n     that your license contains terms that differ from this\n     License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark\n     of Licensor or any Contributor.\n\n   8. Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS\n   LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER\n   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT\n   THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE\n   QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD\n   LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE\n   LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY\n   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY\n   CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED\n   PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n   9. Termination.\n\n     a. Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights\n     granted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to\n     comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within\n     thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses\n     to the Licensed Product that are properly granted shall survive\n     any termination of this license. Provisions that, by their\n     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this\n     License, shall survive.\n\n     b. Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you\n     initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim\n     (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a\n     Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom you file such\n     an action is referred to herein as \"Respondent\") alleging that\n     Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent,\n     then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to you under\n     Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively\n     upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the \"Notice Period\")\n     unless within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i)\n     to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for\n     your past or future use of Licensed Product made by such\n     Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with respect\n     to Licensed Product against such Respondent. If within said\n     Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are\n     not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the\n     litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor\n     to you under Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the\n     expiration of said Notice Period.\n\n     c. Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent\n     infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed\n     Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such\n     claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the\n     initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable\n     value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 1\n     and 2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or\n     value of any payment or license.\n\n     d. No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of\n     termination under Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user\n     license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and\n     reselle rs) that have been validly granted by you or any\n     distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive\n     termination.\n\n  10. Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO\n  LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR\n  OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR\n  OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE\n  LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\n  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER\n  FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR\n  LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE\n  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT\n  APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH\n  PARTYÃ•S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH\n  LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR\n  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION\n  AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  11. Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors,\n  each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly\n  or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this\n  License. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to\n  distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein\n  is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of\n  liability.\n\n  12. U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Product is a \"commercial\n  item,\" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995),\n  consisting of \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial\n  computer software documentation,\" as such terms are used in 48\n  C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48\n  C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all\n  U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Product with only those\n  rights set forth herein.\n\n  13. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement\n  concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this\n  License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be\n  reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This\n  License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to\n  the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding\n  its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that any\n  litigation relating to this license shall be subject to the\n  jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of\n  California or the Superior Court of the County of Santa Clara,\n  California (as appropriate), with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\n  California, with the losing party responsible for costs including,\n  without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and\n  expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n  Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly\n  excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury\n  trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Product or this\n  License. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a\n  contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to\n  this License.\n\n  14. Definition of \"You\" in This License. \"You\" throughout this\n  License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a\n  legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the\n  terms of, this License or a future version of this License issued\n  under Section 7. For legal entities, \"you\" includes any entity that\n  controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For\n  purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (i) the power, direct\n  or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,\n  whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent\n  (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial\n  ownership of such entity.\n\n  15. Glossary. All defined terms in this License that are used in\n  more than one Section of this License are repeated here, in\n  alphabetical order, for the convenience of the reader. The Section\n  of this License in which each defined term is first used is shown in\n  parentheses. Contributor: Each person or entity who created or\n  contributed to the creation of, and distributed, a\n  Modification.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\nï¿½\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nï¿½\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\nï¿½\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\nï¿½\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nï¿½\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n",
  "LucentPLv1.02": " Lucent Public License Version 1.02\n\nTHE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS PUBLIC\nLICENSE (\"AGREEMENT\"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE\nPROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n a. in the case of Lucent Technologies Inc. (\"LUCENT\"), the Original\n    Program, and \n\n b. in the case of each Contributor, \n   \n    i. changes to the Program,\n\n   ii. and additions to the Program; \n\n    where such changes and/or additions to the Program were added to\n    the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such\n    Contributor's behalf, and the Contributor explicitly consents, in\n    accordance with Section 3C, to characterization of the changes\n    and/or additions as Contributions.\n\n\"Contributor\" means LUCENT and any other entity that has Contributed a\nContribution to the Program.\n\n\"Distributor\" means a Recipient that distributes the Program,\nmodifications to the Program, or any part thereof.\n\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor\nwhich are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution\nalone or when combined with the Program.\n\n\"Original Program\" means the original version of the software\naccompanying this Agreement as released by LUCENT, including source\ncode, object code and documentation, if any.\n\n\"Program\" means the Original Program and Contributions or any part\nthereof\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this\nAgreement, including all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n    copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,\n    publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the\n    Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative\n    works, in source code and object code form.\n\n b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n    license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such\n    Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The\n    patent license granted by a Contributor shall also apply to the\n    combination of the Contribution of that Contributor and the\n    Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the\n    Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\n    combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent\n    license granted by a Contributor shall not apply to (i) any other\n    combinations which include the Contribution, nor to (ii)\n    Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is\n    licensed hereunder.\n\n c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other\n    entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for\n    claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\n    intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to\n    exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each\n    Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other\n    intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n    third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\n    distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to\n    acquire that license before distributing the Program.  Each\n    Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the\n    copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA. Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under\n   this Agreement or under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;\n \n b. if the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible\n    form, a copy of this Agreement or Distributor's own license\n    agreement is included with each copy of the Program; and\n\n c. if distributed under Distributor's own license agreement, such\n    license agreement:\n\n     i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n        warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n        warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n        implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and\n        fitness for a particular purpose;\n\n    ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all\n        liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n        incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n        and\n\n   iii. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement\n        are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other\n        party.\n\nB. Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous\nlocation in the Program:\n\n    Copyright (C) 2003, Lucent Technologies Inc. and others. All\n    Rights Reserved.\n\nC. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the\noriginator of its Contribution in a manner that reasonably allows\nsubsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the\nContribution. Also, each Contributor must agree that the additions\nand/or changes are intended to be a Contribution. Once a Contribution\nis contributed, it may not thereafter be revoked.  \n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain\nresponsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the\nlike. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use\nof the Program, the Distributor who includes the Program in a\ncommercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not\ncreate potential liability for Contributors. Therefore, if a\nDistributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,\nsuch Distributor (\"Commercial Distributor\") hereby agrees to defend\nand indemnify every Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against\nany losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from\nclaims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party\nagainst the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts\nor omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its\ndistribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The\nobligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\ninfringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)\npromptly notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim,\nand b) allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and cooperate with\nthe Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\nclaim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial\nDistributor. If that Commercial Distributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Distributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Distributor would have to\ndefend claims against the Contributors related to those performance\nclaims and warranties, and if a court requires any Contributor to pay\nany damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor must pay those\ndamages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\nPROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY\nWARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\nOR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely\nresponsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\ndistributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\nexercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to\nthe risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable\nlaws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and\nunavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\nANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\nINCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\nWITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\nLIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\nNEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR\nDISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED\nHEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. EXPORT CONTROL\n\nRecipient agrees that Recipient alone is responsible for compliance\nwith the United States export administration regulations (and the\nexport control laws and regulation of any other countries).\n\n8. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with\nrespect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or\ncounterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that\nContributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as\nof the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient\ninstitutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\ncross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\nitself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or\nhardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\nrights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\nlitigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably\npracticable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and\nany licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall\ncontinue and survive.\n\nLUCENT may publish new versions (including revisions) of this\nAgreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be\ngiven a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\nContributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\nAgreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new\nversion of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to\ndistribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new\nversion. No one other than LUCENT has the right to modify this\nAgreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,\nRecipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property\nof any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by\nimplication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\nexpressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and\nthe intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No\nparty to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement\nmore than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives\nits rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n",

DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS. \n\n    3.1 Application of License. \n\n      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed \n      by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. \n      The Source Code version of Covered Software may be distributed only under \n      the terms of this License or a future version of this License released \n      under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every \n      copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any \n      terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable \n      version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You \n      may include an additional document offering the additional rights \n      described in Section 3.5. \n\n    3.2 Availability of Source Code. \n\n      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made \n      available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on \n      the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic \n      Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version \n      available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, \n      must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it \n      initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent \n      version of that particular Modification has been made available to such \n      recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version \n      remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is \n      maintained by a third party. \n\n    3.3 Description of Modifications. \n\n      You must cause all Covered Software to which You contribute to contain a \n      file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Software and \n      the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the \n      Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software \n      provided by Nokia and including the name of Nokia in (a) the Source Code, \n      and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in \n      which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Software. \n\n    3.4 Intellectual Property Matters \n\n      a) Third Party Claims. \n\n        If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's \n        intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted \n        by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include \n        a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL'' which \n        describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail \n        that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such \n        knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in \n        Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all \n        copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps \n        (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably \n        calculated to inform those who received the Covered Software that new \n        knowledge has been obtained. \n\n      b) Contributor APIs. \n\n        If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming \n        interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are \n        reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also \n        include this information in the LEGAL file. \n\n      c) Representations. \n\n        Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section \n        3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are \n        Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient \n        rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. \n\n    3.5 Required Notices. \n\n      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source \n      Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code \n      file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location \n      (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for \n      such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your \n      name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also \n      duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You \n      describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered \n      Software. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, \n      support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of \n      Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not \n      on behalf of Nokia or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear \n      that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is \n      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every \n      Contributor for any liability incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a \n      result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. \n\n    3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions. \n\n      You may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the \n      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Software, \n      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the \n      Covered Software is available under the terms of this License, including a \n      description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section \n      3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an \n      Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You \n      describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Software. You may \n      distribute the Executable version of Covered Software or ownership rights \n      under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from \n      this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this \n      License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt \n      to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from \n      the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable \n      version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that \n      any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by \n      Nokia or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every \n      Contributor for any liability incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a \n      result of any such terms You offer. \n\n    3.7 Larger Works. \n\n      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other \n      software not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the \n      Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the \n      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software. \n\n  4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION. \n\n    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License \n    with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial \n    order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this \n    License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and \n    the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file \n    described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the \n    Source Code. \n\n    Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description \n    must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able \n    to understand it. \n\n  5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE. \n\n    This License applies to code to which Nokia has attached the notice in \n    Exhibit A and to related Covered Software. \n\n  6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE. \n\n    6.1 New Versions. \n\n      Nokia may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to \n      time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. \n\n    6.2 Effect of New Versions. \n\n      Once Covered Software has been published under a particular version of the \n      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that \n      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Software under the terms \n      of any subsequent version of the License published by Nokia. No one other \n      than Nokia has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered \n      Software created under this License. \n\n  7.

TERMINATION. \n\n    8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate \n    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such \n    breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to \n    the Covered Software which are properly granted shall survive any \n    termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain \n    in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. \n\n    8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim \n    (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Nokia or a Contributor (Nokia \n    or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \n    \"Participant\") alleging that: \n\n      a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes \n      any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You \n      under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice \n      from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after \n      receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a \n      mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of \n      Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation \n      claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If \n      within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are \n      not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim \n      is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections \n      2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day \n      notice period specified above. \n\n      b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's \n      Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any \n      rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) \n      are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, \n      distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. \n\n    8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging \n    that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes \n    any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) \n    prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the \n    reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections \n    2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of \n    any payment or license. \n\n    8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end \n    user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have \n    been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to \n    termination shall survive termination. \n\n  9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. \n\n    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING \n    NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, NOKIA, ANY OTHER \n    CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY \n    OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, \n    INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT \n    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR \n    MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH \n    PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS \n    LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL \n    INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW \n    PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR \n    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, BUT MAY ALLOW LIABILITY \n    TO BE LIMITED; IN SUCH CASES, A PARTY's, ITS EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS OR \n    AFFILIATES' LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO U.S. $50. Nothing contained in \n    this License shall prejudice the statutory rights of any party dealing as a \n    consumer. \n\n  10. MISCELLANEOUS. \n\n    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter \n    hereof. All rights in the Covered Software not expressly granted under this \n    License are reserved. Nothing in this License shall grant You any rights to \n    use any of the trademarks of Nokia or any of its Affiliates, even if any of \n    such trademarks are included in any part of Covered Software and/or \n    documentation to it. \n\n    This License is governed by the laws of Finland excluding its \n    conflict-of-law provisions. All disputes arising from or relating to this \n    Agreement shall be settled by a single arbitrator appointed by the Central \n    Chamber of Commerce of Finland. The arbitration procedure shall take place \n    in Helsinki, Finland in the English language. If any part of this Agreement \n    is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the \n    balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable according \n    to its terms. \n\n  11. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. \n\n    As between Nokia and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims \n    and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of \n    rights under this License and You agree to work with Nokia and Contributors \n    to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.

If it\n        is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file\n        due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a\n        location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be\n        likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to\n        charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n        obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\n        may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\n        Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear\n        that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation\n        is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the\n        Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\n        by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of\n        warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n        3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n        You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n        requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered\n        Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code\n        version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this\n        License, including a description of how and where You have\n        fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be\n        conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,\n        related documentation or collateral in which You describe\n        recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute\n        the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your\n        choice, which may contain terms different from this License,\n        provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License\n        and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to\n        limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version\n        from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the\n        Executable version under a different license You must make it\n        absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are\n        offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any\n        Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer\n        and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\n        Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You\n        offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered\n        Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the\n        documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.\n\n        3.7. Larger Works.\n        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other\n        code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the\n        Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure\n        the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered\n        Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n        If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n        License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\n        statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of\n        this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of\n        the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully\n        with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they\n        affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file\n        described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all\n        distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited\n        by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently\n        detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand\n        it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\n        This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n        attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n        6.1. New Versions.\n        License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the\n        License from time to time. Each version will be given a\n        distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to\n        opensource.org for certification.\n\n        6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n        Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\n        the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of\n        that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under\n        the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by\n        Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the\n        right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under\n        this License.\n\n        6.3. Derivative Works.\n        If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in\n        association with the required Developer Specific License described\n        in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code\n        which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you\n        must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open'',\n        ``OpenPL'', ``OPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear\n        anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your\n        version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open\n        Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,\n        Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A\n        shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this\n        License.)\n\n6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License\n\n        This license is a union of the following two parts that should be\n        found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of\n        preeminence:\n\n           [1] A Developer specific license.\n\n           [2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general\n           licensing policy of the software.\n\n        In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license,\n        the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by\n        the terms of the higher numbered part.\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n        COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n        WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n        WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\n        DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\n        NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\n        THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE\n        DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER\n        CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\n        CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART\n        OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER\n        EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n        8.1 Termination upon Breach\n\n        This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n        such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.  All\n        sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall\n        survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their\n        nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\n        shall survive.\n\n         \n\n        8.2.  Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by\n        asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment\n        actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial\n        Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred\n        to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\n\n               (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\n               indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights\n               granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or\n               2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant\n               terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt\n               of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a\n               mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future\n               use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw\n               Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version\n               against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a\n               reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually\n               agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\n               is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You\n               under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the\n               expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n               (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such\n               Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly\n               infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such\n               Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked\n               effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,\n               distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\n               Participant.\n\n        8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n        alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\n        indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\n        by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n        infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n        granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n        into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n        license.\n\n        8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all\n        end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\n        which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\n        prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n         \n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL\n        DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\n        OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER\n        PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\n        OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF\n        GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND\n        ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE\n        BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n        LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\n        RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\n        PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n        EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\n        THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n        The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in\n        48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct.  1995), consisting of ``commercial computer\n        software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such\n        terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\n        C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\n        all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\n        rights set forth herein.\n\n11.

You agree to work with affected parties to distribute with\n        Initial Developer responsibility on an equitable basis.\n\nEXHIBIT A.\n\n        Text for this Exhibit A is found in the corresponding addendum,\n        described in section 6.4 above, text file provided by the Initial\n        Developer.

Phrase \"Based on TrueCrypt, freely available at\n    http://www.truecrypt.org/\" must be displayed by Your Product\n    (if technically feasible) and contained in its\n    documentation. Alternatively, if This Product or its portion\n    You included in Your Product constitutes only a minor\n    portion of Your Product, phrase \"Portions of this product\n    are based in part on TrueCrypt, freely available at\n    http://www.truecrypt.org/\" may be displayed instead.

The\n    text(s) of the license(s) must be included with every copy\n    of Your Product that You make and distribute.\n\n    e. You must not change the license terms of This Product in\n    any way (adding any new terms is considered changing the\n    license terms even if the original terms are retained),\n    which means, e.g., that no part of This Product may be put\n    under another license. You must keep intact all the legal\n    notices contained in the source code files. You must include\n    the following items with every copy of Your Product that You\n    make and distribute: a clear and conspicuous notice stating\n    that Your Product or portion(s) thereof is/are governed by\n    this version of the TrueCrypt License, a verbatim copy of\n    this version of the TrueCrypt License (as contained herein),\n    a clear and conspicuous notice containing information about\n    where the included copy of the License can be found, and an\n    appropriate copyright notice.\n\n\n2. You are not obligated to comply with Subsection III.1.d if\nYour Product is not distributed (i.e., Your Product is available\nonly to You).\n\n\n\nIV.

You may not offer or impose any\nterms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability\nof the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that\nrecipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the\nWork. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to\nthe disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute\nor Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work,\nYou may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that\nrestrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the\nrights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This\nSection 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but\nthis does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be\nmade subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,\nupon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,\nremove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as\nrequested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor\nYou must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any\ncredit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.\n\n    b. Subject to the exception in Section 4(c), you may not exercise\nany of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that\nis primarily intended for or directed to ward commercial advantage or\nprivate monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other\ncopyrighted works by means of digital filesharing or otherwise shall not\nbe considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage\nor private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any\nmonetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\n\nc. *You may exercise the rights granted in Section 3 for commercial\npurposes only if:*\n\n    i. *You are a workerowned business or workerowned collective; and*\n    ii. *all financial gain, surplus, profits and benefits produced by\nthe business or collective are distributed among the workerowners*\n\n      d. Any use by a business that is privately owned and managed, and\nthat seeks to generate profit from the labor of employees paid by salary\nor other wages, is not permitted under this license.\n\n    e. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any\nAdaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made\npursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copy right notices for the\nWork and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing:\n(i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if\nsupplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate\nanother party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity,\njournal) for attribution (Attribution Parties) in Licensors copyright\nnotice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such\nparty or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the\nextent reason ably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies\nto be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the\ncopyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv)\nconsistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit\nidentifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., French\ntranslation of the Work by Original Author, or Screenplay based on\noriginal Work by Original Author). The credit required by this Section\n4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,\nthat in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit\nwill appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation\nor Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at\nleast as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this\nSection for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,\nby exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or\nexplicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or\nendorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,\nas appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,\nexpress prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or\nAttribution Parties.\n\n    f. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n        i. Nonwaivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those\njurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any\nstatutory or compulsory licensing scheme can not be waived, the Licensor\nreserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise\nby You of the rights granted under this License;\n\n        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions\nin which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\ncompulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the\nexclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the\nrights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for\na purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted\nunder Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties\nthrough any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,\n        iii.Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right\nto collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the\nLicensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary\nlicensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the\nrights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is\notherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b).\n\n    g. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may\nbe otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute\nor Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\nAdaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or\ntake other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be\nprejudicial to the Original Authors honor or reputation. Licensor\nagrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise\nof the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make\nAdaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,\nmodification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original\nAuthors honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as\nappropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\napplicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right\nunder Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not\notherwise.\n\n 5. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMER\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\nOFFERS THE WORK ASIS AND MAKES NO REP RESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\nKIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\nINCLUD ING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTI BILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\nLATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,\nWHETHER OR NOT DIS COVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\nEXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT AP PLY TO YOU.\n\n 6. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL\nLICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,\nINCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF\nTHIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED\nOF THE POS SIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n7. TERMINATION\n\n    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\nautomatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\nIndividuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\nfrom You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\nterminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\ncompliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\nsurvive any termination of this License.\n\n    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted\nhere is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the\nWork). Notwithstanding the above, Li censor reserves the right to\nrelease the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing\nthe Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not\nserve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or\nis required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\nLicense will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\nstated above.\n\n 8. MISCELLANEOUS\n\n    a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a\nCollection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work\non the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under\nthis License.\n\n    b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,\nLicensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the\nsame terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable\nunder applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability\nof the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further\naction by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be\nreformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid\nand enforceable.\n\n    d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and\nno breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\nand signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n\n    e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\nwith respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\nagreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\nhere. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may\nappear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified\nwithout the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n    f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in\nthis License were draft ed utilizing the terminology of the Berne\nConvention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended\non September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\nTreaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and\nthe Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These\nrights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in\nwhich the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the\ncorresponding provisions of the implemen tation of those treaty\nprovisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of\nrights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights\nnot granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be\nincluded in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the\nlicense of any rights under applicable law.\n",

You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\n     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\n     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include\n     an additional document offering the additional rights described in\n     Section 3.5.\n\n     3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\n     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\n     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\n     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\n     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic\n     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\n     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six\n     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\n     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\n     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\n     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n     3.3. Description of Modifications.\n     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\n     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\n     the date of any change.

Intellectual Property Matters\n          (a) Third Party Claims.\n          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's\n          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\n          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,\n          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\n          distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the\n          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will\n          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after\n          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,\n          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\n          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\n          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\n          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered\n          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n          (b) Contributor APIs.\n          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\n          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which\n          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\n          also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n               (c)    Representations.\n          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\n          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\n          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\n          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\n          this License.\n\n     3.5. Required Notices.\n     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\n     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\n     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\n     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)\n     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\n     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\n     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\n     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to\n     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\n     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\n     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\n     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\n     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\n     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\n     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\n     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\n     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\n     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\n     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\n     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\n     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\n     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\n     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\n     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\n     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\n     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\n     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\n     terms You offer.\n\n     3.7. Larger Works.\n     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\n     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\n     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\n     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\n     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\n     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\n     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\n     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n     understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\n     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n     6.1. New Versions.\n     Netscape Communications Corporation (\"Netscape\") may publish revised\n     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version\n     will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n     6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the\n     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\n     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\n     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one\n     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to\n     Covered Code created under this License.\n\n     6.3. Derivative Works.\n     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\n     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\n     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\n     the phrases \"Mozilla\", \"MOZILLAPL\", \"MOZPL\", \"Netscape\",\n     \"MPL\", \"NPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your\n     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)\n     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license\n     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and\n     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial\n     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in\n     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of\n     this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\n     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\n     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\n     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\n     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\n     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\n     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\n     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\n     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\n     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\n     shall survive.\n\n     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\n     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\n     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\n     You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\")  alleging that:\n\n     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\n     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\n     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\n     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\n     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\n     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\n     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\n     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\n     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\n     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\n     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\n     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\n     the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\n     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\n     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\n     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\n     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\n     Participant.\n\n     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\n     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\n     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n     license.\n\n     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\n     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\n     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\n     prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\n     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\n     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\n     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\n     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\n     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\n     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\n     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\n     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n     The Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in\n     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\n     software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such\n     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\n     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\n     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\n     rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\n     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if\n     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.\n     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,\n     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United\n     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be\n     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern\n     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\n     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\n     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and\n     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\n     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\n     License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\n     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n\n     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n     \"Multiple-Licensed\".  \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial\n     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\n     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified\n     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\n\nEXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.\n\n     ``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License\n     Version 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in\n     compliance with the License.

Distribution Obligations.\n\n3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to\n     which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License,\n     including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version\n     of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this\n     License or a future version of this License released under\n     Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with\n     every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer\n     or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or\n     restricts the applicable version of this License or the\n     recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an\n     additional document offering the additional rights described in\n     Section 3.5.\n\n3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or\n     to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code\n     form under the terms of this License either on the same media as\n     an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution\n     Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version\n     available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution\n     Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months\n     after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)\n     months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\n     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible\n     for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even\n     if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third\n     party.\n\n3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to\n     which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes\n     You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any\n     change. You must include a prominent statement that the\n     Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\n     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of\n     the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any\n     notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which\n     You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n\n     (a) Third Party Claims.\n\n         If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third\n         party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise\n         the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or\n         2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source\n         Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim\n         and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a\n         recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains\n         such knowledge after the Modification is made available as\n         described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify\n         the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available\n         thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying\n         appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably\n         calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that\n         new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n    (b) Contributor APIs.  \n\n        If Contributor's Modifications include an application\n        programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent\n        licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,\n        Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL\n        file.\n\n    (c) Representations.\n\n        Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\n        Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\n        Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\n        Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed\n        by this License.  \n\ntrend\n<http://trenduhren.de/>\n\n3.5. Required Notices.\n\n     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the\n     Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a\n     particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must\n     include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)\n     where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You\n     created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a\n     Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also\n     duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code\n     where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights\n     relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge\n     a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations\n     to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so\n     only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\n     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear\n     than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n     obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to\n     indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n     liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor\n     as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms\n     You offer.\n\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered\n     Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code\n     version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this\n     License, including a description of how and where You have\n     fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be\n     conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,\n     related documentation or collateral in which You describe\n     recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may\n     distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership\n     rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms\n     different from this License, provided that You are in compliance\n     with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the\n     recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\n     forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version\n     under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that\n     any terms which differ from this License are offered by You\n     alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You\n     hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\n     Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer\n     or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n3.7. Larger Works.\n\n     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other\n     code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the\n     Larger Work as a single LEDs product. In such a case, You must\n     make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the\n     Covered Code. 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or\n     Regulation.\n\n     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of\n     this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due\n     to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a)\n     comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent\n     possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they\n     affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file\n     described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all\n     distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited\n     by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently\n     detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n     understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\n   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n   attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n6.1. New Versions.\n\n     Netizen Pty Ltd (\"Netizen \") may publish revised and/or new\n     versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be\n     given a distinguishing version number.\n\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version\n     of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms\n     of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code\n     under the terms of any subsequent version of the License\n     published by Netizen. No one other than Netizen has the right to\n     modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this\n     License.\n\n6.3. Derivative Works.\n\n     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which\n     you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already\n     Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your\n     license so that the phrases \"Netizen\", \"NOSL\" or any confusingly\n     similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that\n     your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it\n     clear that Your version of the license contains terms which\n     differ from the Netizen Open Source License and Xen Open Source\n     License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original\n     Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall\n     not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS\n   FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\n   NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE\n   OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE\n   DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY\n   OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,\n   REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN\n   ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS\n   AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n7.1 To the extent permitted by law and except as expressly provided to\n    the contrary in this Agreement, all warranties whether express,\n    implied, statutory or otherwise, relating in any way to the\n    subject matter of this Agreement or to this Agreement generally,\n    are excluded. Where legislation implies in this Agreement any\n    condition or warranty and that legislation avoids or prohibits\n    provisions in a contract excluding or modifying the application of\n    or the exercise of or liability under such term, such term shall\n    be deemed to be included in this Agreement. However, the liability\n    of Supplier for any breach of such term shall be limited, at the\n    option of Supplier, to any one or more of the following: if the\n    breach related to goods: the replacement of the goods or the\n    supply of equivalent goods; the repair of such goods; the payment\n    of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent\n    goods; or the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired;\n    and if the breach relates to services the supplying of the\n    services again; or the payment of the cost of having the services\n    supplied again.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to\n     cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the\n     breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly\n     granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions\n     which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the\n     termination of this License shall survive.\n\n8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\n     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial\n     Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor\n     against whom You file such action is referred to as\n     \"Participant\") alleging that:\n\n     (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n         infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\n         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this\n         License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate\n         prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of\n         notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a\n         mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and\n         future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii)\n         withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the\n         Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60\n         days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement\n         are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the\n         litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by\n         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2\n         automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day\n         notice period specified above.\n\n     (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such\n         Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly\n         infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such\n         Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked\n         effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,\n         distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\n         Participant.\n\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\n     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved\n     (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of\n     patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the\n     licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2\n     shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of\n     any payment or license.\n\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all\n     end user license agreements (excluding distributors and\n     resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any\n     distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive\n     termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n   (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n   INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n   COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO\n   ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n   DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR\n   LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION,\n   OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH\n   PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n   DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY\n   FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE\n   TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME\n   JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF\n   INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND\n   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n    The Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined\n    in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\n    software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as\n    such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent\n    with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4\n    (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code\n    with only those rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n    necessary to make it enforceable.

Useful information\ncan also be found in the JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article.  See\nARCHIVE LOCATIONS below to find out where to obtain the FAQ article.\n\nIf you want to understand how the JPEG code works, we suggest reading one or\nmore of the REFERENCES, then looking at the documentation files (in roughly\nthe order listed) before diving into the code.\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n========\n\nThis package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and\ndecompression.  JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized compression\nmethod for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing\n\"real-world\" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images\nare not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not\nexactly identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use JPEG if you\nhave to have identical output bits.  However, on typical photographic images,\nvery good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and\nremarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a\nlow-quality image.  For more details, see the references, or just experiment\nwith various compression settings.\n\nThis software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive\ncompression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these\nprocesses, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.\nFor legal reasons, we are not distributing code for the arithmetic-coding\nvariants of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES.  We have made no provision for supporting\nthe hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.\n\nWe provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,\nplus two sample applications \"cjpeg\" and \"djpeg\", which use the library to\nperform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.\nThe library is intended to be reused in other applications.\n\nIn order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included\nconsiderable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;\nfor example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG\ndecoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or\ncolormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the\nlibrary if not required for a particular application.  We have also included\n\"jpegtran\", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG\nprocesses, and \"rdjpgcom\" and \"wrjpgcom\", two simple applications for\ninserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.\n\nThe emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and\nflexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,\nthe software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the\nREFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to\nbe reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have\nachieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.\n\nWe welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.\nNo royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product\ndocumentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.\n\n\nLEGAL ISSUES\n============\n\nIn plain English:\n\n1.

Peter Deutsch,\nsole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.\nansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead\nby the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,\nthat you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file\nansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part\nof any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than\nthe foregoing paragraphs do.\n\nThe Unix configuration script \"configure\" was produced with GNU Autoconf.\nIt is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.\nThe same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,\nltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright\nby M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.\n\nIt appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by\npatents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot\nlegally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,\nsupport for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.\n(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented\nHuffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)\nSo far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining\ncode.\n\nThe IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.\nTo avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has\nbeen removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce\n\"uncompressed GIFs\".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the\nresulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard\nGIF decoders.\n\nWe are required to state that\n    \"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of\n    CompuServe Incorporated.

If you don't have the CACM issue\nhandy, a PostScript file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is\navailable at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/wallace.ps.gz.  The file (actually\na preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)\nomits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections\nand some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,\nand it may not be used for commercial purposes.\n\nA somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in\n\"The Data Compression Book\" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by\nM&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides\ngood explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods\nincluding JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C\ncode but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG\nsample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look\nat a full implementation, you've got one here...\n\nThe best full description of JPEG is the textbook \"JPEG Still Image Data\nCompression Standard\" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published\nby Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.  Price US$59.95, 638 pp.\nThe book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1\nand draft DIS 10918-2).  This is by far the most complete exposition of JPEG\nin existence, and we highly recommend it.\n\nThe JPEG standard itself is not available electronically; you must order a\npaper copy through ISO or ITU.  (Unless you feel a need to own a certified\nofficial copy, we recommend buying the Pennebaker and Mitchell book instead;\nit's much cheaper and includes a great deal of useful explanatory material.)\nIn the USA, copies of the standard may be ordered from ANSI Sales at (212)\n642-4900, or from Global Engineering Documents at (800) 854-7179.  (ANSI\ndoesn't take credit card orders, but Global does.)  It's not cheap: as of\n1992, ANSI was charging $95 for Part 1 and $47 for Part 2, plus 7%\nshipping/handling.  The standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the\nactual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1\nis titled \"Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,\nPart 1: Requirements and guidelines\" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS\n10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled \"Digital Compression and Coding of\nContinuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing\" and has document\nnumbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.\n\nSome extensions to the original JPEG standard are defined in JPEG Part 3,\na newer ISO standard numbered ISO/IEC IS 10918-3 and ITU-T T.84.  IJG\ncurrently does not support any Part 3 extensions.\n\nThe JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file\nformat.  For the omitted details we follow the \"JFIF\" conventions, revision\n1.02.  A copy of the JFIF spec is available from:\n\tLiterature Department\n\tC-Cube Microsystems, Inc.\n\t1778 McCarthy Blvd.\n\tMilpitas, CA 95035\n\tphone (408) 944-6300,  fax (408) 944-6314\nA PostScript version of this document is available by FTP at\nftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text\nversion at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing\nthe figures.\n\nThe TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from\nftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme\nfound in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.\nIJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).\nInstead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2\n(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from ftp.sgi.com or\nfrom ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/.  It is expected that the next revision\nof the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.\nAlthough IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library\nuses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.  libtiff is available\nfrom ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/.\n\n\nARCHIVE LOCATIONS\n=================\n\nThe \"official\" archive site for this software is ftp.uu.net (Internet\naddress 192.48.96.9).  The most recent released version can always be found\nthere in directory graphics/jpeg.  This particular version will be archived\nas ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz.  If you don't have\ndirect Internet access, UUNET's archives are also available via UUCP; contact\nhelp@uunet.uu.net for information on retrieving files that way.\n\nNumerous Internet sites maintain copies of the UUNET files.  However, only\nftp.uu.net is guaranteed to have the latest official version.\n\nYou can also obtain this software in DOS-compatible \"zip\" archive format from\nthe SimTel archives (ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/graphics/), or\non CompuServe in the Graphics Support forum (GO CIS:GRAPHSUP), library 12\n\"JPEG Tools\".  Again, these versions may sometimes lag behind the ftp.uu.net\nrelease.\n\nThe JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a useful source of\ngeneral information about JPEG.  It is updated constantly and therefore is\nnot included in this distribution.  The FAQ is posted every two weeks to\nUsenet newsgroups comp.graphics.misc, news.answers, and other groups.\nIt is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/\nand other news.answers archive sites, including the official news.answers\narchive at rtfm.mit.edu: ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/.\nIf you don't have Web or FTP access, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\nwith body\n\tsend usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part1\n\tsend usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part2\n\n\nRELATED SOFTWARE\n================\n\nNumerous viewing and image manipulation programs now support JPEG.  (Quite a\nfew of them use this library to do so.)  The JPEG FAQ described above lists\nsome of the more popular free and shareware viewers, and tells where to\nobtain them on Internet.\n\nIf you are on a Unix machine, we highly recommend Jef Poskanzer's free\nPBMPLUS software, which provides many useful operations on PPM-format image\nfiles.  In particular, it can convert PPM images to and from a wide range of\nother formats, thus making cjpeg/djpeg considerably more useful.  The latest\nversion is distributed by the NetPBM group, and is available from numerous\nsites, notably ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM/.\nUnfortunately PBMPLUS/NETPBM is not nearly as portable as the IJG software is;\nyou are likely to have difficulty making it work on any non-Unix machine.\n\nA different free JPEG implementation, written by the PVRG group at Stanford,\nis available from ftp://havefun.stanford.edu/pub/jpeg/.  This program\nis designed for research and experimentation rather than production use;\nit is slower, harder to use, and less portable than the IJG code, but it\nis easier to read and modify.  Also, the PVRG code supports lossless JPEG,\nwhich we do not.  (On the other hand, it doesn't do progressive JPEG.)\n\n\nFILE FORMAT WARS\n================\n\nSome JPEG programs produce files that are not compatible with our library.\nThe root of the problem is that the ISO JPEG committee failed to specify a\nconcrete file format.  Some vendors \"filled in the blanks\" on their own,\ncreating proprietary formats that no one else could read.  (For example, none\nof the early commercial JPEG implementations for the Macintosh were able to\nexchange compressed files.)\n\nThe file format we have adopted is called JFIF (see REFERENCES).  This format\nhas been agreed to by a number of major commercial JPEG vendors, and it has\nbecome the de facto standard.  JFIF is a minimal or \"low end\" representation.\nWe recommend the use of TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 as modified by TIFF\nTechnical Note #2) for \"high end\" applications that need to record a lot of\nadditional data about an image.  TIFF/JPEG is fairly new and not yet widely\nsupported, unfortunately.\n\nThe upcoming JPEG Part 3 standard defines a file format called SPIFF.\nSPIFF is interoperable with JFIF, in the sense that most JFIF decoders should\nbe able to read the most common variant of SPIFF.  SPIFF has some technical\nadvantages over JFIF, but its major claim to fame is simply that it is an\nofficial standard rather than an informal one.  At this point it is unclear\nwhether SPIFF will supersede JFIF or whether JFIF will remain the de-facto\nstandard.  IJG intends to support SPIFF once the standard is frozen, but we\nhave not decided whether it should become our default output format or not.\n(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading JFIF indefinitely.)\n\nVarious proprietary file formats incorporating JPEG compression also exist.\nWe have little or no sympathy for the existence of these formats.  Indeed,\none of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help\nforce convergence on common, open format standards for JPEG files.  Don't\nuse a proprietary file format!\n\n\nTO DO\n=====\n\nThe major thrust for v7 will probably be improvement of visual quality.\nThe current method for scaling the quantization tables is known not to be\nvery good at low Q values.  We also intend to investigate block boundary\nsmoothing, \"poor man's variable quantization\", and other means of improving\nquality-vs-file-size performance without sacrificing compatibility.\n\nIn future versions, we are considering supporting some of the upcoming JPEG\nPart 3 extensions --- principally, variable quantization and the SPIFF file\nformat.\n\nAs always, speeding things up is of great interest.\n\nPlease send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\n",

Vim sponsors can vote for\nfeatures.  See |sponsor|.  The money goes to Uganda anyway.\n\nThe Open Publication License applies to the Vim documentation, see\n|manual-copyright|.\n\n\nVIM LICENSE\n\nI)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except\n    that they must include this license text.  You can also distribute\n    unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must\n    include this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables\n    that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage\n    examples and Vim scripts.\n\nII) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,\n    including executables and/or source code, when the following four\n    conditions are met:\n    1) This license text must be included unmodified.\n    2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:\n       a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in\n\t  the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you\n\t  (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you\n\t  must make your changes, including source code, available to the\n\t  maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to\n\t  include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the\n\t  maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they\n\t  will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation\n\t  then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.\n\tThe current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>. If this \n\t  changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely\n\t  vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When it is completely\n\t  impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him\n\t  your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has\n\t  received your changes they will not have to be sent again.\n       b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as\n\t  mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it\n\t  unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the\n\t  text under a) applies to those changes.\n       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of\n\t  the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of a\n\t  context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you\n\t  add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from\n\t  making their own changes to the official version of Vim.\n       d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned\n\t  under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the\n\t  changes if the following three conditions are met:\n\t  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute\n\t    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and\n\t    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official\n\t    version of Vim without fee or restriction.\n\t  - You keep the changes for at least three years after last\n\t    distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer\n\t    or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in\n\t    any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them\n\t    available to him.\n\t  - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This\n\t    contact information must remain valid for at least three years\n\t    after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long\n\t    as possible.\n       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,\n\t  you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or\n\t  any later version.\n    3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the \":version\"\n       command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim\n       is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned\n       under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does\n       not conflict with the license used for the changes.\n    4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be\n       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make\n       corrections.\n\nIII) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use\n     the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the\n     maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is\n     by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.\n     If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a\n     context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is\n<maintainer@vim.org> \n\nIV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim\n     sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this\n     license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came\n     with, at your option.\n\n\nNote:\n\n- If you are happy with Vim, please express that by reading the rest of this\n  file and consider helping needy children in Uganda.\n\n- If you want to support further Vim development consider becoming a\n  |sponsor|.  The money goes to Uganda anyway.\n\n- According to Richard Stallman the Vim license is GNU GPL compatible.\n  A few minor changes have been made since he checked it, but that should not\n  make a difference.\n\n- If you link Vim with a library that goes under the GNU GPL, this limits\n  further distribution to the GNU GPL.  Also when you didn't actually change\n  anything in Vim.\n\n- Once a change is included that goes under the GNU GPL, this forces all\n  further changes to also be made under the GNU GPL or a compatible license.\n\n- If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you can include your name and\n  contact information with the \"--with-modified-by\" configure argument or the\n  MODIFIED_BY define.\n\n==============================================================================\n\nKibaale Children's Centre\t\t*kcc* *Kibaale*  *charity*\n\nKibaale Children's Centre (KCC) is located in Kibaale, a small town in the\nsouth of Uganda, near Tanzania, in East Africa.  The area is known as Rakai\nDistrict.  The population is mostly farmers.  Although people are poor, there\nis enough food.  But this district is suffering from AIDS more than any other\npart of the world.  Some say that it started there.  Estimations are that 10\nto 30% of the Ugandans are infected with HIV.  Because parents die, there are\nmany orphans.  In this district about 60,000 children have lost one or both\nparents, out of a population of 350,000.  And this is still continuing.\n\nThe children need a lot of help.  The KCC is working hard to provide the needy\nwith food, medical care and education.  Food and medical care to keep them\nhealthy now, and education so that they can take care of themselves in the\nfuture.  KCC works on a Christian base, but help is given to children of any\nreligion.\n\nThe key to solving the problems in this area is education.  This has been\nneglected in the past years with president Idi Amin and the following civil\nwars.  Now that the government is stable again, the children and parents have\nto learn how to take care of themselves and how to avoid infections.  There is\nalso help for people who are ill and hungry, but the primary goal is to\nprevent people from getting ill and to teach them how to grow healthy food.\n\nMost of the orphans are living in an extended family.  An uncle or older\nsister is taking care of them.  Because these families are big and the income\n(if any) is low, a child is lucky if it gets healthy food.  Clothes, medical\ncare and schooling is beyond its reach.  To help these needy children, a\nsponsorship program was put into place.  A child can be financially adopted.\nFor a few dollars a month KCC sees to it that the child gets indispensable\nitems, is healthy, goes to school and KCC takes care of anything else that\nneeds to be done for the child and the family that supports it.\n\nBesides helping the child directly, the environment where the child grows up\nneeds to be improved.  KCC helps schools to improve their teaching methods.\nThere is a demonstration school at the centre and teacher trainings are given.\nHealth workers are being trained, hygiene education is carried out and\nhouseholds are stimulated to build a proper latrine.  I helped setting up a\nproduction site for cement slabs.  These are used to build a good latrine.\nThey are sold below cost price.\n\nThere is a small clinic at the project, which provides children and their\nfamily with medical help.  When needed, transport to a hospital is offered.\nImmunization programs are carried out and help is provided when an epidemic is\nbreaking out (measles and cholera have been a problem).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t*donate*\nSummer 1994 to summer 1995 I spent a whole year at the centre, working as a\nvolunteer.  I have helped to expand the centre and worked in the area of water\nand sanitation.  I learned that the help that the KCC provides really helps.\nWhen I came back to Holland, I wanted to continue supporting KCC.  To do this\nI'm raising funds and organizing the sponsorship program.  Please consider one\nof these possibilities:\n\n1.  Sponsor a child in primary school: 17 euro a month (or more).\n2.  Sponsor a child in secondary school: 25 euro a month (or more).\n3.  Sponsor the clinic: Any amount a month or quarter\n4.  A one-time donation\n\nCompared with other organizations that do child sponsorship the amounts are\nvery low.  This is because the money goes directly to the centre.  Less than\n5% is used for administration.  This is possible because this is a small\norganization that works with volunteers.  If you would like to sponsor a\nchild, you should have the intention to do this for at least one year.\n\nHow do you know that the money will be spent right?  First of all you have my\npersonal guarantee as the author of Vim.  I trust the people that are working\nat the centre, I know them personally.  Further more, the centre is\nco-sponsored and inspected by World Vision, Save the Children Fund and\nInternational Child Care Fund.  The centre is visited about once a year to\ncheck the progress (at our own cost).  I have visited the centre myself in\n1996, 1998, 2000, 2001 and 2003.  The visit reports are on the ICCF web site.\n\nIf you have any further questions, send me e-mail: <Bram@vim.org>. \n\nThe address of the centre is:\n\t\t\tKibaale Children's Centre\n\t\t\tp.o. box 1658\n\t\t\tMasaka, Uganda, East Africa\n\n\nSending money:\t\t\t\t\t\t*iccf-donations*\n\nCheck the ICCF web site for the latest information!

  "Python2.0.1": " Python 2.0.1 license\n\nThis is the official license for the Python 2.0.1 release:\n\nA. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor of a\nlanguage called ABC.  Guido is Python's principal author, although it\nincludes many contributions from others.  The last version released\nfrom CWI was Python 1.2.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python\nat the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston,\nVirginia where he released several versions of the software.  Python\n1.6 was the last of the versions released by CNRI.  In 2000, Guido and\nthe Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the\nBeOpen PythonLabs team.  Python 2.0 was the first and only release\nfrom BeOpen.com.\n\nFollowing the release of Python 1.6, and after Guido van Rossum left\nCNRI to work with commercial software developers, it became clear that\nthe ability to use Python with software available under the GNU Public\nLicense (GPL) was very desirable.  CNRI and the Free Software\nFoundation (FSF) interacted to develop enabling wording changes to the\nPython license.  Python 1.6.1 is essentially the same as Python 1.6,\nwith a few minor bug fixes, and with a different license that enables\nlater versions to be GPL-compatible.  Python 2.0.1 is a derivative work\nof Python 1.6.1, as well as of Python 2.0.\n\nAfter Python 2.0 was released by BeOpen.com, Guido van Rossum and the\nother PythonLabs developers joined Digital Creations.  All\nintellectual property added from this point on, including Python\n2.0.1 and its alpha and beta releases, is owned by the Python Software\nFoundation (PSF), a non-profit modeled after the Apache Software\nFoundation.  See http://www.python.org/psf/ for more information about\nthe PSF.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

  "ODbl": " ## ODC Open Database License (ODbL)\n\n### Preamble\n\nThe Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to\nallow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while\nmaintaining this same freedom for others. Many databases are covered by\ncopyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some\njurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that\ncover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally,\nthe ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to\nact in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.\n\nDatabases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,\naudiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),\nand so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the\ncontents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL\ntogether with another license for the contents, if the contents have a\nsingle set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the\ncontents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should\ndescribe what rights govern what contents together in the individual\nrecord or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply. \n\nSometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be\ncovered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,\ntrade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights\nover information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may\nhave to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing\nactivities not covered by this License.\n\n------\n\nThe Licensor (as defined below) \n\nand \n\nYou (as defined below) \n\nagree as follows: \n\n### 1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words\n\n\"Collective Database\" â€“ Means this Database in unmodified form as part\nof a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are\nassembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective\nDatabase will not be considered a Derivative Database.\n\n\"Convey\" â€“ As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database,\nor the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables\na Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative\nDatabase.  Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a\ncomputer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no\ntransfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.\n\"Contents\" â€“ The contents of this Database, which includes the\ninformation, independent works, or other material collected into the\nDatabase. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual\ndata or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.\n\n\"Database\" â€“ A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a\nsystematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic\nor other means offered under the terms of this License.\n\n\"Database Directive\" â€“ Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection\nof databases, as amended or succeeded.\n\n\"Database Right\" â€“ Means rights resulting from the Chapter III (\"sui\ngeneris\") rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed\nby member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of\nthe whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar\nrights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4. \n\n\"Derivative Database\" â€“ Means a database based upon the Database, and\nincludes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any\nother alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the\nContents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or\nRe-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new\nDatabase.\n\n\"Extraction\" â€“ Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a\nSubstantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in\nany form.\n\n\"License\" â€“ Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights\nsuch as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract.\n\n\"Licensor\" â€“ Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms\nof this License. \n\n\"Person\" â€“ Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons\ncorporate or incorporate.\n\n\"Produced Work\" â€“  a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text,\nor sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the\nContents (via a search or other query) from this Database, a Derivative\nDatabase, or this Database as part of a Collective Database.  \n\n\"Publicly\" â€“ means to Persons other than You or under Your control by\neither more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their\nactivities (such as contracting with an independent consultant). \n\n\"Re-utilisation\" â€“ means any form of making available to the public all\nor a Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by\nrenting, by online or other forms of transmission.\n\n\"Substantial\" â€“ Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a\ncombination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or\nRe-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the\nExtraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.\n\n\"Use\" â€“ As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright\nor Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and\nincludes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing,\npublicly displaying, and preparing derivative works of the Database, as\nwell as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it\nin a different mode or format. \n\n\"You\" â€“ Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not\npreviously violated the terms of this License with respect to the\nDatabase, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to\nexercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\nWords in the singular include the plural and vice versa.\n\n### 2.0 What this License covers\n\n2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:\n\n  a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;\n\n  b. A license of the Database Right; and\n\n  c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.\n\n2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the\nDatabase, including:\n\n  a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.\n  The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the\n  Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents\n  independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright\n  law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database\n  model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation\n  of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table\n  indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of\n  Contents stored in the Database;\n\n  b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and\n  Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.\n  Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the\n  Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed\n  from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would\n  not infringe any applicable copyright; and\n\n  c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for\n  access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of\n  use on this access as outlined in this License. \n\n2.3 Rights not covered. \n\n  a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making\n  or operation of the Database; \n\n  b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the\n  Database; and\n\n  c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the\n  Database. \n\n2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of\nthe Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,\nincluding copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality\nrights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database\nRights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.\nFor example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this\nLicense would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could\nhave their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of\nthe rights over the images.  \n\n### 3.0 Rights granted\n\n3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor\ngrants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but\nonly under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of\nany applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly\ninclude commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To\nthe extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be\nexercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the\nfuture. \n\nThe rights granted cover, for example:\n\n  a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of\n  the Contents;\n\n  b. Creation of Derivative Databases;\n\n  c. Creation of Collective Databases;\n\n  d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and\n  in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative\n  Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and\n\n  e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or\n  performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in\n  part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective\n  Databases.\n\n3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n  a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n  compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves\n  the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\n  of the rights granted under this License;\n\n  b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n  compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the\n  exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of\n  the rights granted under this License; and,\n\n  c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect\n  royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is\n  a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing\n  schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights\n  granted under this License.\n\n3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop\ndistributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that\nthis Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice\nof using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section\n10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.\n\n### 4.0 Conditions of Use\n\n4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to\nYour complying with the following conditions of use. These are important\nconditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be\nin material breach of its terms.\n\n4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You\nmust: \n\n  a. Do so only under the terms of this License or another license\n  permitted under Section 4.4;\n\n  b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license\n  permitted under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n  with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the\n  Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and\n\n  c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices\n  that refer to this License.\n\n  d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular\n  file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a\n  location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to\n  look for it.\n\n4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced\nWork does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you\nPublicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with\nthe Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,\nviews, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced\nWork aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it\nis available under this License.\n\n  a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under\n  Section 4.3:\n\n        Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available\n        here under the Open Database License (ODbL).\n\nDATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a\nhyperlink to the URI of the Database. \"Open Database License\" should\ncontain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If\nhyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the\nrequired URI's with the above notice.\n \n4.4 Share alike. \n\n  a. Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under\n  the terms of: \n\n    i. This License;\n\n    ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this\n      License; or\n\n    iii. A compatible license. \n\n  If You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses\n  mentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license. \n\n  b. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the\n  whole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a\n  Derivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4. \n\n  c. Derivative Databases and Produced Works.  A Derivative Database is\n  Publicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work\n  created from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.\n\n  d. Share Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt,\n  You must not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a\n  that are incompatible with the rights granted under this License. \n\n  e. Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine\n  compatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the\n  authorised proxy's public statement of acceptance of a compatible\n  license grants You permission to use the compatible license.\n\n\n4.5 Limits of Share Alike.  The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply\nin the following:\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license\n  Collective Databases under this License if You incorporate this\n  Database or a Derivative Database in the collection, but this License\n  still applies to this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of\n  the Collective Database; \n\n  b. Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as\n  part of a Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not\n  create a Derivative Database for purposes of  Section 4.4; and\n\n  c. Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is\n  not to the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements\n  of Section 4.4.\n\n4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a Derivative\nDatabase or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also\noffer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy\nin a machine readable form of:\n\n  a. The entire Derivative Database; or\n\n  b. A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or\n  the method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an\n  algorithm), including any additional Contents, that make up all the\n  differences between the Database and the Derivative Database.\n\nThe Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be\navailable at no more than a reasonable production cost for physical\ndistributions and free of charge if distributed over the internet.\n\n4.7 Technological measures and additional terms\n\n  a. This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to\n  Section 4.7 b.)  any terms or any technological measures on the\n  Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of\n  the Contents that alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any\n  rights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting\n  the ability of any person to exercise those rights.\n\n  b. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or technological\n  measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a\n  Substantial part of the Contents (a \"Restricted Database\") in\n  contravention of Section 4.74 a. only if You also make a copy of the\n  Database or a Derivative Database available to the recipient of the\n  Restricted Database:\n\n    i. That is available without additional fee;\n\n    ii. That is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict\n    the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have\n    the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to\n    exercise those rights (an \"Unrestricted Database\"); and\n\n    iii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the\n    recipient as a practical matter as the Restricted Database.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a\n  Derivative Database in an authenticated environment, behind a\n  password, or within a similar access control scheme provided that You\n  do not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any rights\n  granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the\n  ability of any person to exercise those rights. \n\n4.8 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time\nYou communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the\nContents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the\nLicensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same\nterms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for\nenforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may\nenforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are\nsolely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made\nby You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any\nfurther restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed\nunder this License.\n\n### 5.0 Moral rights\n\n5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights\nto be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment\nthat would otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or\nany other derogatory treatment:\n\n  a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives\n  all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest\n  extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section\n  10.4; \n\n  b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant\n  jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral\n  rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the\n  fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under\n  Section 10.4; and\n\n  c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert\n  moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their\n  moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.\n\nPlease note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral\nrights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some\njurisdictions.\n\n### 6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected \n\n6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may\nindependently have under any applicable law to make any use of this\nDatabase, including without limitation:\n\n  a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents\n  from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for\n  purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and\n  Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative\n  or judicial procedure. \n\n  b.

Contributor Grant.\n\n    Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each\n    Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\n    non-exclusive license\n         \n        (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\n        trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce,\n        modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the\n        Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions\n        thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other\n        Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger\n        Work; and\n\n        (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or\n        selling of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone\n        and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or\n        portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for\n        sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications\n        made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the\n        combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its\n        Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).\n\n        (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are\n        effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use\n        of the Covered Code.\n\n        (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is\n        granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the\n        Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version;\n        3) for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications\n        of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of Modifications\n        made by that Contributor with other software (except as part\n        of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under\n        Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of\n        Modifications made by that Contributor.\n\n\n3. Distribution Obligations.\n\n    3.1. Application of License.\n\n    The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\n    governed by the terms of this License, including without\n    limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code\n    may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a\n    future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You\n    must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source\n    Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any\n    Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable\n    version of this License or the recipients' rights\n    hereunder. However, You may include an additional document\n    offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\n\n    3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n\n    Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must\n    be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this\n    License either on the same media as an Executable version or via\n    an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom\n    you made an Executable version available; and if made available\n    via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for\n    at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became\n    available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version\n    of that particular Modification has been made available to such\n    recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code\n    version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution\n    Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n    3.3. Description of Modifications.\n\n    You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain\n    a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered\n    Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent\n    statement that the Modification is derived, directly or\n    indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer\n    and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source\n    Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related\n    documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the\n    Covered Code.\n\n    3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n\n        (a) Third Party Claims.\n\n        If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third\n        party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise\n        the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or\n        2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\n        distribution titled \"LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the\n        party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient\n        will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such\n        knowledge after the Modification is made available as\n        described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify\n        the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available\n        thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying\n        appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated\n        to inform those who received the Covered Code that new\n        knowledge has been obtained.\n\n        (b) Contributor APIs.\n\n        If Contributor's Modifications include an application\n        programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent\n        licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,\n        Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL\n        file.\n         \n        (c)    Representations.\n\n        Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\n        Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\n        Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\n        Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed\n        by this License.\n\n\n    3.5. Required Notices.\n\n    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the\n    Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a\n    particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must\n    include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)\n    where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You\n    created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a\n    Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also\n    duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code\n    where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating\n    to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee\n    for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one\n    or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on\n    Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\n    Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such\n    warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by\n    You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer\n    and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\n    Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n    indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n    3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n    requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered\n    Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code\n    version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this\n    License, including a description of how and where You have\n    fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be\n    conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,\n    related documentation or collateral in which You describe\n    recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may\n    distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership\n    rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms\n    different from this License, provided that You are in compliance\n    with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n    Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the\n    recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\n    forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version\n    under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that\n    any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,\n    not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree\n    to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as\n    a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n    3.7. Larger Works.\n\n    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other\n    code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the\n    Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make\n    sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the\n    Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of\n    this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due\n    to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a)\n    comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent\n    possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they\n    affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file\n    described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all\n    distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited\n    by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently\n    detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n    understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\n    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n    attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n    6.1. New Versions.\n\n    Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish\n    revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each\n    version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n    6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\n    the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of\n    that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under\n    the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by\n    Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the\n    terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n\n    6.3. Derivative Works.\n\n    If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you\n    may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already\n    Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your\n    license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'',\n    ''Netscape'', \"MPL\", ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do\n    not appear in your license (except to note that your license\n    differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that\n    Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the\n    Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in\n    the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in\n    the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be\n    deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS'' BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS\n    FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\n    NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE\n    OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE\n    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY\n    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,\n    REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN\n    ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS\n    AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n    8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to\n    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the\n    breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly\n    granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions\n    which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the\n    termination of this License shall survive.\n\n    8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent\n    infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against\n    Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or\n    Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as\n    \"Participant\") alleging that:\n\n    (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\n    Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\n    shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate\n    prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice\n    You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually\n    agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of\n    Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your\n    litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against\n    such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable\n    royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in\n    writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,\n    the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or\n    2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice\n    period specified above.\n\n    (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such\n    Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly\n    infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such\n    Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective\n    as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had\n    made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n\n    8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against\n    Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version\n    directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is\n    resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the\n    initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable\n    value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections\n    2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount\n    or value of any payment or license.\n\n    8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\n    all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and\n    resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any\n    distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive\n    termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n    COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO\n    ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n    DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES\n    FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR\n    MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,\n    EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\n    SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO\n    LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S\n    NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH\n    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR\n    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS\n    EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n    The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined\n    in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial\n    computer software'' and ''commercial computer software\n    documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212\n    (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48\n    C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all\n    U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\n    rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed\n    by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law,\n    if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law\n    provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party\n    is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do\n    business in the United States of America, any litigation relating\n    to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the\n    Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue\n    lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party\n    responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs\n    and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of\n    the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\n    Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which\n    provides that the language of a contract shall be construed\n    against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or\n    indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License\n    and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to\n    distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing\n    herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission\n    of liability.\n\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n\n    Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n    ï¿½Multiple-Licensedï¿½.  ï¿½Multiple-Licensedï¿½ means that the Initial\n    Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code\n    under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any,\n    specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in\n    Exhibit A.\n\n\nEXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.\n\n    ``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public\n    License Version 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file\n    except in compliance with the License.

Notwithstanding the\n        foregoing, when You \"stand in the shoes\" of Yahoo!, You are\n        not subject to the jurisdiction provision under Section 7,\n        which requires all disputes under this Agreement to be subject\n        to the jurisdiction of federal or state courts of northern\n        California.\n\n        1.4 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in\n        compiled or object code format, You must also provide\n        recipients with access to the Software or Modification in\n        source code format along with a complete copy of this\n        Agreement. The distribution of the Software or Modifications\n        in compiled or object code format may be under a license of\n        Your choice, provided that You are in compliance with the\n        terms of this Agreement. In addition, You must make absolutely\n        clear that any license terms applying to such Software or\n        Modification that differ from this Agreement are offered by\n        You alone and not by Yahoo!, and that such license does not\n        restrict recipients from exercising rights in the source code\n        to the Software granted by Yahoo! under this Agreement or\n        rights in the source code to any Modification granted by You\n        as described in Section 1.3.\n\n        1.5 - This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute\n        files that are entirely Your own work (i.e., which do not\n        incorporate any portion of the Software and are not\n        Modifications) under any terms You choose.\n\n 2. Support\n\n        Yahoo! has no obligation to provide technical support or\n        updates to You. Nothing in this Agreement requires Yahoo! to\n        enter into any license with You for any other edition of the\n        Software.\n\n 3. Intellectual Property Rights\n\n        3.1 - Except for the license expressly granted under copyright\n        in Section 1.1, no rights, licenses or forbearances are\n        granted or may arise in relation to this Agreement whether\n        expressly, by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or\n        otherwise. All rights, including all intellectual property\n        rights, that are not expressly granted under this Agreement\n        are hereby reserved.\n\n        3.2 - In any copy of the Software or in any Modification you\n        create, You must retain and reproduce, any and all copyright,\n        patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are included\n        in the Software in the same form as they appear in the\n        Software. This includes the preservation of attribution\n        notices in the form of trademarks or logos that exist within a\n        user interface of the Software.\n\n        3.3 - This license does not grant You rights to use any\n        party's name, logo, or trademarks, except solely as necessary\n        to comply with Section 3.2.\n\n 4. Disclaimer of Warranties\n\n        THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n        KIND. YAHOO! MAKES NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR\n        STATUTORY REGARDING OR RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE. SPECIFICALLY,\n        YAHOO! DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE\n        OR WILL PERFORM IN AN UNINTERRUPTED MANNER. TO THE GREATEST\n        EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, YAHOO! SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL\n        IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A\n        PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF YAHOO! HAD BEEN INFORMED OF SUCH\n        PURPOSE), AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE,\n        ANY MODIFICATIONS THERETO AND WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE\n        FOREGOING.\n\n 5. Limitation of Liability\n\n        IN NO EVENT WILL YAHOO! BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\n        INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF\n        ANY KIND (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS\n        OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF COVER) IN\n        CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE\n        FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER\n        RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF\n        CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, AND EVEN\n        IF YAHOO! HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n 6. Term and Termination\n\n        6.1 - This Agreement will continue in effect unless and until\n        terminated earlier pursuant to this Section 6.\n\n        6.2 - In the event You violate the terms of this Agreement,\n        Yahoo! may terminate this Agreement.\n\n        6.3 - All licenses granted hereunder shall terminate upon the\n        termination of this Agreement. Termination will be in addition\n        to any rights and remedies available to Yahoo! at law or\n        equity or under this Agreement.\n\n        6.4 - Termination of this Agreement will not affect the\n        provisions regarding reservation of rights (Section 3.1),\n        provisions disclaiming or limiting Yahoo!'s liability\n        (Sections 4 and 5), Termination (Section 6) or Miscellaneous\n        (Section 7), which provisions will survive termination of this\n        Agreement.\n\n 7. Miscellaneous\n\n        This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties\n        with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and\n        supersedes all previous communications, representations,\n        understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between\n        the parties with respect to said subject matter. The\n        relationship of the parties hereunder is that of independent\n        contractors, and this Agreement will not be construed as\n        creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other\n        form of legal association between the parties. If any term,\n        condition, or provision in this Agreement is found to be\n        invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, this\n        Agreement will be construed in a manner that most closely\n        effectuates the intent of this Agreement. Such invalid term,\n        condition or provision will be severed from the remaining\n        terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue to be\n        valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by\n        law. This Agreement will be interpreted and construed in\n        accordance with the laws of the State of California and the\n        United States of America, without regard to conflict of law\n        principles. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the\n        International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this\n        Agreement. All disputes arising out of this Agreement\n        involving Yahoo! or any of its subsidiaries shall be subject\n        to the jurisdiction of the federal or state courts of northern\n        California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\n        California. No rights may be assigned, no obligations may be\n        delegated, and this Agreement may not be transferred by You,\n        in whole or in part, whether voluntary or by operation of law,\n        including by way of sale of assets, merger or consolidation,\n        without the prior written consent of Yahoo!, and any purported\n        assignment, delegation or transfer without such consent shall\n        be void ab initio. Any waiver of the provisions of this\n        Agreement or of a party's rights or remedies under this\n        Agreement must be in writing to be effective. Failure, neglect\n        or delay by a party to enforce the provisions of this\n        Agreement or its rights or remedies at any time, will not be\n        construed or be deemed to be a waiver of such party's rights\n        under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the\n        validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or\n        prejudice such party's right to take subsequent action.\n"
