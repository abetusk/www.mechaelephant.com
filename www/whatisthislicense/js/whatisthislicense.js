This license may be particularly\nsuitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but\nyou may use it with small modifications even if your work is unrelated\nto TeX.\n\nThe section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',\nbelow, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors\nwho are considering distributing their works under this license.\n\nThis license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed\nand modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of\nthat work may be distributed.\n\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you\nthe freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work\nthat conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while\nmaintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of\nthat work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while\nmeeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'\nand `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n===========\n\nIn this license document the following terms are used:\n\n   `Work'\n    Any work being distributed under this License.\n    \n   `Derived Work'\n    Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.\n\n   `Modification' \n    Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable\n    law -- for example, the production of a file containing an\n    original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of\n    such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\n    translated into another language.\n\n   `Modify'\n    To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any\n    applicable law.\n    \n   `Distribution'\n    Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in\n    whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)\n    making any electronic components of the Work accessible by\n    file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file\n    systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).\n\n   `Compiled Work'\n    A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it\n    is directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may\n    include using installation facilities provided by the Work,\n    transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or\n    other activities.  Note that modification of any installation\n    facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.\n\n   `Current Maintainer'\n    A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is\n    no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under\n    any applicable law.\n\n   `Base Interpreter' \n    A program or process that is normally needed for running or\n    interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.    \n    A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these\n    are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each\n    external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used\n    interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the\n    license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a\n    \"LaTeX-Format\".\n\n\n\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n===========================================\n\n1.  Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work\nare not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In\nparticular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no\nrequirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.\n\n2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you\nreceived it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered\nmodification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived\nWork may be assumed under the terms of this clause.\n\n3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a\ncomplete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2\nabove, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that\nthe recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly\nas it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work\ndirectly from the Work.\n\n4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without\nrestriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may\nalso distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including\nCompiled Works generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works\ndistributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to\nbe updated versions of the Work.\n\n5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify\nyour copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,\nand compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on\nthe Derived Work.\n\n6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\ndistribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met\nfor every component of the Work unless that component clearly states\nin the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition.  Only\nthe Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption \nto a component of the Work. \n\n  a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement\n     for a component of the Work when that component is used with the\n     Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work\n     identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that\n     Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work\n     clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version\n     of this component to the user when used interactively with that\n     Base Interpreter.\n     \n  b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices\n     detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a\n     prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part\n     of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log\n     of the changes.\n  \n  c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,\n     including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version\n     of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)\n     the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the\n     Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that\n     they do provide such support for the Derived Work.\n\n  d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:\n\n       1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; \n          if your distribution of a modified component is made by\n          offering access to copy the modified component from a\n          designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\n          the Work from the same or some similar place meets this\n          condition, even though third parties are not compelled to\n          copy the Work along with the modified component;\n\n       2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified\n          copy of the Work.\n\n7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\ndistribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as\nthe Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled\nWork, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with\nregard to the Derived Work.\n\n8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do\nnot apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it\nbecomes identical to an  updated version of that component of the Work as\nit is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.\n\n9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative\nformat, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is\nthen produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or\nnullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of\napplying that process.\n     \n10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license\n       provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in\n       Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have\n       to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.\n      \n    b. If a Derived Work is distributed under this license, that\n       Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of\n       itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the \n       restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.\n\n11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to\nthe Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating\nsuch works with the Work by any means.\n\n12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent\ncomplete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.\n\n\nNO WARRANTY\n===========\n\nThere is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in\nwriting, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without\nwarranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not\nlimited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for\na particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance\nof the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you\nassume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\n\nIn no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing\nwill The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of\nthe Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work\nas permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any\ngeneral, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of\nany use of the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including,\nbut not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or\nlosses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to\noperate with any other programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said\nauthor or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such\ndamages.\n\n\nMAINTENANCE OF THE WORK\n=======================\n\nThe Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder\nexplicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in\nthe Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder\nor simply that is `author-maintained'.\n\nThe Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer\nwho has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error\nreports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail\naddress). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge\nor act upon these error reports.\n\nThe Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there\nis no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current\nMaintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means\nof communication for a period of six months, and there are no other\nsignificant signs of active maintenance.\n\nYou can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with\nany existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.\n\nIf the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of\nthe Work through the following steps:\n\n 1.  Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and\n     the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of\n     an Internet or similar search.\n\n 2.  If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work\n     is still maintained.\n\n  a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer\n     to update their communication data within one month.\n     \n  b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active\n     maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce\n     within the pertinent community your intention to take over\n     maintenance.  (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be\n     done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)\n\n 3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass\n     maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect\n     immediately upon announcement.\n     \n  b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright\n     Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you,\n     then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.  \n    \n 4.  If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above\n     and after three months your intention is challenged neither by\n     the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other\n     people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as\n     to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.\n     \n 5.  If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes\n     reachable once more within three months of a change completed\n     under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must\n     become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided\n     they then update their communication data within one month.\n\nA change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact\nthat the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.\n\nIf you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should\nimmediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous\nstatement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You should also\nannounce your new status to the same pertinent community as\nin 2b) above.\n\n\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE\n======================================================\n\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and\nrecommendations for authors who are considering distributing their\nworks under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in\nthis section.\n\nChoosing This License or Another License\n----------------------------------------\n\nIf for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*\nconditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then\ndo not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,\ndistribute your work under a different license.  You may use the text\nof this license as a model for your own license, but your license\nshould not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that\nyour work is distributed under the LPPL.\n\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains\nthe motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,\nfor example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public\nLicense (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your work is\nunrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be\nrelevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any\nlicense are encouraged to read it.\n\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own\npersonal use, without also meeting the above conditions for\ndistributing the modified component.  While you might intend that such\nmodifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by\naccident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or\nit may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified\nversion that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions\nof this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,\ncause problems for the community.  It is therefore usually in your\nbest interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public\none.  Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work\nwithout altering any of its licensed components.\n\nHow to Use This License\n-----------------------\n\nTo use this license, place in each of the components of your work both\nan explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work\nwas authored and/or last substantially modified.  Include also a\nstatement that the distribution and/or modification of that\ncomponent is constrained by the conditions in this license.\n\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\n\n  %% pig.dtx\n  %% Copyright 2003 M. Y. Name\n  %\n  % This work may be distributed and/or modified under the\n  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3\n  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\n  % The latest version of this license is in\n  %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt\n  % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX\n  % version 2003/12/01 or later.\n  %\n  % This work has the LPPL maintenance status \"maintained\".\n  % \n  % This Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.\n  %\n  % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\n  % and the derived file pig.sty.\n\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions\ngiven in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring\nto the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being\ngenerated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'\nreferring to any \"LaTeX-Format\", and both `Copyright Holder' and\n`Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.\n\nIf you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your\nWork, change \"maintained\" above into \"author-maintained\".  \nHowever, we recommend that you use \"maintained\" as the Maintenance\nsection was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to\nthe community even when you can no longer maintain and support it\nyourself.\n\n\nImportant Recommendations\n-------------------------\n\n Defining What Constitutes the Work\n\n   The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the\n   files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a\n   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.\n   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the\n   files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by\n   using a line such as:\n\n    % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\n   \n   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be\n   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you\n   to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be\n   entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise\n   the Work.\n",
  "CPLv1.0": " Common Public License - v 1.0\n\nUpdated 16 Apr 2009\n\nAs of 25 Feb 2009, IBM has assigned the Agreement Steward role for the\nCPL to the Eclipse Foundation. Eclipse has designated the Eclipse\nPublic License (EPL) as the follow-on version of the CPL.\n\nTHE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON\nPUBLIC LICENSE (\"AGREEMENT\"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF\nTHE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n    documentation distributed under this Agreement, and \n\n    b) in the case\n    of each subsequent Contributor:\n\n    i) changes to the Program, and\n\n    ii) additions to the Program;\n\n    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\n    and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n    'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\n    such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's\n    behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program\n    which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\n    conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,\n    and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor\nwhich are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution\nalone or when combined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this\nAgreement, including all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n    copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,\n    publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the\n    Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative\n    works, in source code and object code form.\n\n    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n    license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such\n    Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This\n    patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution\n    and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the\n    Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\n    combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent\n    license shall not apply to any other combinations which include\n    the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\n    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other\n    entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for\n    claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\n    intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to\n    exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each\n    Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other\n    intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n    third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\n    distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to\n    acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\n    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n    sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n    the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form\nunder its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\n    b) its license agreement:\n\n    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n    warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n    warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n    implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n    for a particular purpose;\n\n    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all\n    liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement\n    are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;\n    and\n\n    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n    Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\n    reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for\n    software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and \n\n    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. \n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\nwithin the Program.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\nContribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\nRecipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain\nresponsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the\nlike. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use\nof the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a\ncommercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not\ncreate potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a\nContributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,\nsuch Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend\nand indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\")\nagainst any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising\nfrom claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party\nagainst the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts\nor omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its\ndistribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The\nobligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\ninfringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)\npromptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,\nand b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with\nthe Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\nclaim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those\nperformance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\nContributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor\nmust pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\nPROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY\nWARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\nOR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely\nresponsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\ndistributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\nexercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to\nthe risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable\nlaws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and\nunavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6.

DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS\n\n3.1. Application of License.\n\n    The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\n    governed by the terms of this License, including without\n    limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code\n    may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a\n    future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You\n    must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source\n    Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any\n    Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable\n    version of this License or the recipients' rights\n    hereunder. However, You may include an additional document\n    offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\n\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n\n    Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must\n    be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this\n    License via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to\n    anyone to whom you made an Executable version available and to the\n    Initial Developer; and if made available via Electronic\n    Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve\n    (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at\n    least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular\n    Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are\n    responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains\n    available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is\n    maintained by a third party. You are responsible for notifying the\n    Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the\n    Source if a contact means is provided. Red Hat will be acting as\n    maintainer of the Source and may provide an Electronic\n    Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made\n    available. You can contact Red Hat to make the Modification\n    available and to notify the Initial\n    Developer. (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos/)\n\n3.3. Description of Modifications.\n\n    You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain\n    a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered\n    Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent\n    statement that the Modification is derived, directly or\n    indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer\n    and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source\n    Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related\n    documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the\n    Covered Code.\n\n3.4.

If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your\n        Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall\n        promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make\n        available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as\n        notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably\n        calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that\n        new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n        (b) Contributor APIs.\n\n        If Your Modification is an application programming interface\n        and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary\n        to implement that API, you must also include this information\n        in the LEGAL file.\n\n3.5. Required Notices.\n\n    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the\n    Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source\n    Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered\n    Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your\n    name as a Contributor to the Source Code. If it is not possible to\n    put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its\n    structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such\n    as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look\n    for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee\n    for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one\n    or more recipients of Covered Code.\n\n    However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\n    of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it\n    absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or\n    liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree\n    to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as\n    a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You\n    offer.\n\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n    requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered\n    Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code\n    version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this\n    License, including a description of how and where You have\n    fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be\n    conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,\n    related documentation or collateral in which You describe\n    recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may\n    distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license\n    of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this\n    License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of\n    this License and that the license for the Executable version does\n    not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source\n    Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You\n    distribute the Executable version under a different license You\n    must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from\n    this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n    Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n    Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\n    by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any\n    such terms You offer.\n\n    If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you\n    must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or\n    other materials provided with the product.\n\n3.7.

INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute\nor regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\nto the maximum extent possible; (b) cite the statute or regulation\nthat prohibits you from adhering to the license; and (c) describe the\nlimitations and the code they affect. Such description must be\nincluded in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be\nincluded with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\nextent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\nsufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\nunderstand it. You must submit this LEGAL file to Red Hat for review,\nand You will not be able use the covered code in any means until\npermission is granted from Red Hat to allow for the inability to\ncomply due to statute or regulation.\n\n5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE\n\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\nattached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n\nRed Hat may include Covered Code in products without such additional\nproducts becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may\nlicense such additional products on different terms from those\ncontained in this License.\n\nRed Hat may license the Source Code of Red Hat Branded Code without\nRed Hat Branded Code becoming subject to the terms of this License,\nand may license Red Hat Branded Code on different terms from those\ncontained in this License. Contact Red Hat for details of alternate\nlicensing terms available.\n\n6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE\n\n6.1. New Versions.\n\n    Red Hat may publish revised and/or new versions of the License\n    from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing\n    version number.\n\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\n    the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of\n    that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under\n    the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by\n    Red Hat. No one other than Red Hat has the right to modify the\n    terms applicable to Covered Code beyond what is granted under this\n    and subsequent Licenses.\n\n6.3. Derivative Works.\n\n    If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you\n    may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already\n    Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your\n    license so that the phrases \"ECOS\", \"eCos\", \"Red Hat\", \"RHEPL\" or\n    any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your\n    license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the\n    license contains terms which differ from the Red Hat eCos Public\n    License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original\n    Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not\n    of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n7.

  "LGPLv2.1": " GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 2.1, February 1999\n\n Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS AND\nCONDITIONS OF THE LICENSE, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE IN ANY MANNER.\n\n1. General; Definitions. This License applies only to the following\nsoftware programs: the open source versions of Sybaseâ€™s Watcom C/C++\nand Fortran compiler products (â€œSoftwareâ€�), which are modified\nversions of, with significant changes from, the last versions made\ncommercially available by Sybase. As used in this License:\n\n1.1 \"Applicable Patent Rights\" mean: (a) in the case where Sybase is\nthe grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter\nacquired, owned by or assigned to Sybase and (ii) that cover subject\nmatter contained in the Original Code, but only to the extent\nnecessary to use, reproduce and/or distribute the Original Code\nwithout infringement; and (b) in the case where You are the grantor of\nrights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired,\nowned by or assigned to You and (ii) that cover subject matter in Your\nModifications, taken alone or in combination with Original Code.\n\n1.2 \"Contributor\" means any person or entity that creates or\ncontributes to the creation of Modifications.\n\n1.3 \"Covered Code\" means the Original Code, Modifications, the\ncombination of Original Code and any Modifications, and/or any\nrespective portions thereof.\n\n1.4 \"Deploy\" means to use, sublicense or distribute Covered Code other\nthan for Your internal research and development (R&D) and/or Personal\nUse, and includes without limitation, any and all internal use or\ndistribution of Covered Code within Your business or organization\nexcept for R&D use and/or Personal Use, as well as direct or indirect\nsublicensing or distribution of Covered Code by You to any third party\nin any form or manner.\n\n1.5 \"Larger Work\" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions\nthereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.\n\n1.6 \"Modifications\" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change\nto, the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous\nModifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous\nModifications, and/or any respective portions thereof. When code is\nreleased as a series of files, a Modification is: (a) any addition to\nor deletion from the contents of a file containing Covered Code;\nand/or (b) any new file or other representation of computer program\nstatements that contains any part of Covered Code.\n\n1.7 \"Original Code\" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other\nwork as originally made available by Sybase under this License,\nincluding the Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs\nor works made available by Sybase under this License, and that has\nbeen expressly identified by Sybase as such in the header file(s) of\nsuch work; and (b) the object code compiled from such Source Code and\noriginally made available by Sybase under this License.\n\n1.8 \"Personal Use\" means use of Covered Code by an individual solely\nfor his or her personal, private and non-commercial purposes. An\nindividual's use of Covered Code in his or her capacity as an officer,\nemployee, member, independent contractor or agent of a corporation,\nbusiness or organization (commercial or non-commercial) does not\nqualify as Personal Use.\n\n1.9 \"Source Code\" means the human readable form of a program or other\nwork that is suitable for making modifications to it, including all\nmodules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,\nscripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable\n(object code).\n\n1.10 \"You\" or \"Your\" means an individual or a legal entity exercising\nrights under this License.

Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions.Subject to the terms and\nconditions of this License, Sybase hereby grants You, effective on the\ndate You accept this License and download the Original Code, a\nworld-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of\nSybase's Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original\nCode, to do the following:\n\n2.1 You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and distribute\nOriginal Code, with or without Modifications, solely for Your internal\nresearch and development and/or Personal Use, provided that in each\ninstance:\n\n(a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the\n    copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Sybase\n    as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices\n    in the Original Code that refer to this License; and\n\n(b) You must retain and reproduce a copy of this License with every\n    copy of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You\n    distribute, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such\n    Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients'\n    rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6.\n\n(c) Whenever reasonably feasible you should include the copy of this\n    License in a click-wrap format, which requires affirmative\n    acceptance by clicking on an \"I accept\" button or similar\n    mechanism. If a click-wrap format is not included, you must\n    include a statement that any use (including without limitation\n    reproduction, modification or distribution) of the Software, and\n    any other affirmative act that you define, constitutes acceptance\n    of the License, and instructing the user not to use the Covered\n    Code in any manner if the user does not accept all of the terms\n    and conditions of the License.\n\n2.2 You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy\nCovered Code, provided that in each instance:\n\n(a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to\n    the Source Code of the Covered Code;\n\n(b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the\n    notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your\n    Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent\n    notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any\n    change;\n\n(c) You must make Source Code of all Your Deployed Modifications\n    publicly available under the terms of this License, including the\n    license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you\n    Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of\n    initial Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably\n    distribute the Source Code of Your Deployed Modifications\n    electronically (e.g. download from a web site);\n\n(d) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only,\n    You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as\n    in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered\n    Code is available under the terms of this License with information\n    on how and where to obtain such Source Code; and\n\n(e) the object code form of the Covered Code may be distributed under\n    Your own license agreement, provided that such license agreement\n    contains terms no less protective of Sybase and each Contributor\n    than the terms of this License, and stating that any provisions\n    which differ from this License are offered by You alone and not by\n    any other party.\n\n2.3 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Sybase and each\nContributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the\nCovered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Sybase or\nany Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or\nother intellectual property rights of any other entity. Sybase and\neach Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by\nany other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights\nor otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses\ngranted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any\nother intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\nthird party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the\nCovered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before\ndistributing the Covered Code.\n\n3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the\nlicenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to Sybase\nand all third parties a non-exclusive, royalty-free license, under\nYour Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights\n(other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce,\ndisplay, perform, modify, distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of\nthe same scope and extent as Sybase's licenses under Sections 2.1 and\n2.2.\n\n4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered\nCode with other code not governed by the terms of this License and\ndistribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance,\nYou must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for\nthe Covered Code or any portion thereof.\n\n5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in\nSection 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by\nSybase herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require\nadditional patent licenses from Sybase which Sybase may grant in its\nsole discretion.\n\n6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other\nrights consistent with this License (\"Additional Terms\") to one or\nmore recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your\nown behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of\nSybase or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement\nthat any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You\nhereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Sybase and every\nContributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted\nagainst Sybase or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional\nTerms.\n\n7. Versions of the License. Sybase may publish revised and/or new\nversions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given\na distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published\nunder a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it\nunder the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such\nOriginal Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this\nLicense published by Sybase.

Notwithstanding any term to the contrary in any\n    Compatible Source License, any code covered by any Compatible\n    Source License that is used with Covered Code must be made readily\n    available in Source Code format for royalty-free use under the\n    terms of the Compatible Source License or this License.\n\n1.3 \"Contributor\" means any person or entity that creates or\n    contributes to the creation of Modifications.\n\n1.4 \"Covered Code\" means the Original Code, Modifications, the\n    combination of Original Code and any Modifications, and/or any\n    respective portions thereof.\n\n1.5 \"Deploy\" means to use, sublicense or distribute Covered Code other\n    than for Your internal research and development (R&D) and/or\n    Personal Use, and includes without limitation, any and all\n    internal use or distribution of Covered Code within Your business\n    or organization except for R&D use and/or Personal Use, as well as\n    direct or indirect sublicensing or distribution of Covered Code by\n    You to any third party in any form or manner.\n\n1.6 \"Derivative Work\" means either the Covered Code or any derivative\n    work under United States copyright law, and including any work\n    containing or including any portion of the Covered Code or\n    Modifications, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\n    translated into another language. Derivative Work also includes\n    any work which combines any portion of Covered Code or\n    Modifications with code not otherwise governed by the terms of\n    this License.\n\n1.7 \"Externally Deploy\" means to Deploy the Covered Code in any way\n    that may be accessed or used by anyone other than You, used to\n    provide any services to anyone other than You, or used in any way\n    to deliver any content to anyone other than You, whether the\n    Covered Code is distributed to those parties, made available as an\n    application intended for use over a computer network, or used to\n    provide services or otherwise deliver content to anyone other than\n    You.\n\n1.8. \"Interface\" means interfaces, functions, properties, class\n     definitions, APIs, header files, GUIDs, V-Tables, and/or\n     protocols allowing one piece of software, firmware or hardware to\n     communicate or interoperate with another piece of software,\n     firmware or hardware.\n\n1.9 \"Modifications\" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change\n    to, the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any\n    previous Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any\n    previous Modifications, and/or any respective portions\n    thereof. When code is released as a series of files, a\n    Modification is: (a) any addition to or deletion from the contents\n    of a file containing Covered Code; and/or (b) any new file or\n    other representation of computer program statements that contains\n    any part of Covered Code.\n\n1.10 \"Original Code\" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other\n     work as originally made available by Licensor under this License,\n     including the Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such\n     programs or works made available by Licensor under this License,\n     and that has been expressly identified by Licensor as such in the\n     header file(s) of such work; and (b) the object code compiled\n     from such Source Code and originally made available by Licensor\n     under this License.\n\n1.11 \"Personal Use\" means use of Covered Code by an individual solely\n     for his or her personal, private and non-commercial purposes. An\n     individual's use of Covered Code in his or her capacity as an\n     officer, employee, member, independent contractor or agent of a\n     corporation, business or organization (commercial or\n     non-commercial) does not qualify as Personal Use.\n\n1.12 \"Source Code\" means the human readable form of a program or other\n     work that is suitable for making modifications to it, including\n     all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition\n     files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an\n     executable (object code).\n\n1.13 \"You\" or \"Your\" means an individual or a legal entity exercising\n     rights under this License.

Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms and\n   conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You, effective\n   on the date You accept this License (via downloading or using\n   Covered Code or otherwise indicating your acceptance of this\n   License), a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive copyright\n   license, to the extent of Licensor's copyrights cover the Original\n   Code, to do the following:\n\n2.1 You may reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy Covered\n    Code, provided that in each instance:\n\n (a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the\n     copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of\n     Licensor as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all\n     notices in the Original Code that refer to this License;\n\n (b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source\n     Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You\n     may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter\n     or restrict this License or the recipients' rights hereunder,\n     except as permitted under Section 6;\n\n (c) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the\n     notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your\n     Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent\n     notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any\n     change;\n\n (d) You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed\n     Modifications publicly available under the terms of this License,\n     including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as\n     long as you Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from\n     the date of initial Deployment, whichever is longer. You should\n     preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Deployed\n     Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site); and\n\n (e) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only,\n     You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well\n     as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the\n     Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with\n     information on how and where to obtain such Source Code. You must\n     also include the Object Code Notice set forth in Exhibit A in the\n     \"about\" box or other appropriate place where other copyright\n     notices are placed, including any packaging materials.\n\n2.2 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and\n    each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions\n    of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided\n    by Licensor or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not\n    infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any\n    other entity. Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability\n    to You for claims brought by any other entity based on\n    infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a\n    condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,\n    You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other\n    intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n    third party patent license is required to allow You to make, use,\n    sell, import or offer for sale the Covered Code, it is Your\n    responsibility to acquire such license(s).\n\n2.3 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor\n    hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License\n    (via downloading or using Covered Code or otherwise indicating\n    your acceptance of this License), a worldwide, royalty-free,\n    perpetual, non-exclusive patent license under Licensor's\n    Applicable Patent Rights to make, use, sell, offer for sale and\n    import the Covered Code, provided that in each instance you comply\n    with the terms of this License.\n\n3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the\n   licenses granted to You under this License:\n\n (a) You grant to Licensor and all third parties a non-exclusive,\n     perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free license under Your\n     Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights\n     owned or controlled by You, to make, sell, offer for sale, use,\n     import, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and\n     Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as\n     Licensor's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2; and\n\n (b) You grant to Licensor and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive,\n     worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under\n     Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property\n     rights owned or controlled by You, to make, use, sell, offer for\n     sale, import, reproduce, display, perform, distribute, modify or\n     have modified (for Licensor and/or its subsidiaries), sublicense\n     and distribute Your Modifications, in any form and for any\n     purpose, through multiple tiers of distribution.\n\n (c) You agree not use any information derived from Your use and\n     review of the Covered Code, including but not limited to any\n     algorithms or inventions that may be contained in the Covered\n     Code, for the purpose of asserting any of Your patent rights, or\n     assisting a third party to assert any of its patent rights,\n     against Licensor or any Contributor.\n\n4. Derivative Works. You may create a Derivative Work by combining\n   Covered Code with other code not otherwise governed by the terms of\n   this License and distribute the Derivative Work as an integrated\n   product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements\n   of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion\n   thereof, including all Modifications.\n\n4.1 You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute, publish or\n    Externally Deploy, that in whole or in part contains or is derived\n    from the Covered Code or any part thereof, to be licensed as a\n    whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this\n    License and no other license except as provided in Section\n    4.2. You also must make Source Code available for the Derivative\n    Work under the same terms as Modifications, described in Sections\n    2 and 3, above.\n\n4.2 Compatible Source Licenses. Software modules that have been\n    independently developed without any use of Covered Code and which\n    contain no portion of the Covered Code, Modifications or other\n    Derivative Works, but are used or combined in any way with the\n    Covered Code or any Derivative Work to form a larger Derivative\n    Work, are exempt from the conditions described in Section 4.1 but\n    only to the extent that: the software module, including any\n    software that is linked to, integrated with, or part of the same\n    applications as, the software module by any method must be wholly\n    subject to one of the Compatible Source Licenses. Notwithstanding\n    the foregoing, all Covered Code must be subject to the terms of\n    this License. Thus, the entire Derivative Work must be licensed\n    under a combination of the RPSL (for Covered Code) and a\n    Compatible Source License for any independently developed software\n    modules within the Derivative Work. The foregoing requirement\n    applies even if the Compatible Source License would ordinarily\n    allow the software module to link with, or form larger works with,\n    other software that is not subject to the Compatible Source\n    License. For example, although the Mozilla Public License v1.1\n    allows Mozilla code to be combined with proprietary software that\n    is not subject to the MPL, if MPL-licensed code is used with\n    Covered Code the MPL-licensed code could not be combined or linked\n    with any code not governed by the MPL. The general intent of this\n    section 4.2 is to enable use of Covered Code with applications\n    that are wholly subject to an acceptable open source license. You\n    are responsible for determining whether your use of software with\n    Covered Code is allowed under Your license to such software.\n\n4.3 Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Covered Code\n    with the Covered Code (or with a work based on the Covered Code)\n    on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the\n    other work under the scope of this License. If You deliver the\n    Covered Code for combination and/or integration with an\n    application previously provided by You (for example, via automatic\n    updating technology), such combination and/or integration\n    constitutes a Derivative Work subject to the terms of this\n    License.\n\n5. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be\n   deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents,\n   trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any\n   Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No right is granted\n   to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks\n   are included in the Covered Code. Nothing in this License shall be\n   interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different\n   terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have\n   a right to license. Modifications, Derivative Works and/or any use\n   or combination of Covered Code with other technology provided by\n   Licensor or third parties may require additional patent licenses\n   from Licensor which Licensor may grant in its sole discretion. No\n   patent license is granted separate from the Original Code or\n   combinations of the Original Code with other software or hardware.\n\n5.1. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the\n     trademarks or trade names owned by Licensor (\"Licensor Marks\"\n     defined in Exhibit C) or to any trademark or trade name belonging\n     to any Contributor. No Licensor Marks may be used to endorse or\n     promote products derived from the Original Code other than as\n     permitted by the Licensor Trademark Policy defined in Exhibit C.\n\n6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\n   warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other\n   rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein\n   (\"Additional Terms\") to one or more recipients of Covered\n   Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your\n   sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Licensor or any\n   Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any\n   such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby\n   agree to indemnify, defend and hold Licensor and every Contributor\n   harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against\n   Licensor or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional\n   Terms.\n\n7. Versions of the License. Licensor may publish revised and/or new\n   versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be\n   given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been\n   published under a particular version of this License, You may\n   continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also\n   choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent\n   version of this License published by Licensor. No one other than\n   Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered\n   Code created under this License.\n\n8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in\n   part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered\n   Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data,\n   and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly\n   acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion\n   thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS\n   PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY\n   KIND AND LICENSOR AND LICENSOR'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED\n   TO AS \"LICENSOR\" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL\n   CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS,\n   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\n   WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY\n   QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET\n   ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. LICENSOR AND\n   EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR\n   ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE\n   COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE\n   COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS\n   IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN\n   DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR, A LICENSOR\n   AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A\n   WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for\n   use in high risk activities, including, but not limited to, the\n   design, construction, operation or maintenance of nuclear\n   facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft communication systems, or\n   air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the\n   Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe\n   physical or environmental damage. Licensor disclaims any express or\n   implied warranty of fitness for such uses.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO\n   EVENT SHALL LICENSOR OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY\n   INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT\n   OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n   COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF\n   CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT\n   LIABILITY), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR OR\n   SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n   DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY\n   REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n   OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT\n   APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Licensor's total liability to You\n   for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law)\n   under this License exceed the amount of ten dollars ($10.00).\n\n10. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License,\n    each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to\n    any Modifications made by such Contributor. Licensor retains all\n    rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any\n    Modifications made by or on behalf of Licensor (\"Licensor\n    Modifications\"), and such Licensor Modifications will not be\n    automatically subject to this License. Licensor may, at its sole\n    discretion, choose to license such Licensor Modifications under\n    this License, or on different terms from those contained in this\n    License or may choose not to license them at all.\n\n11. Termination.\n\n11.1 Term and Termination. The term of this License is perpetual\n     unless terminated as provided below. This License and the rights\n     granted hereunder will terminate:\n\n (a) automatically without notice from Licensor if You fail to comply\n     with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach\n     within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach;\n\n (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in\n     Section 12.5(b); or\n\n (c) automatically without notice from Licensor if You, at any time\n     during the term of this License, commence an action for patent\n     infringement against Licensor (including by cross-claim or\n     counter claim in a lawsuit);\n\n (d) upon written notice from Licensor if You, at any time during the\n     term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement\n     against any third party alleging that the Covered Code itself\n     (excluding combinations with other software or hardware)\n     infringes any patent (including by cross-claim or counter claim\n     in a lawsuit).\n\n11.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately\n     stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing\n     and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of\n     the Covered Code that are in your possession or control. All\n     sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted\n     prior to termination shall survive any termination of this\n     License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in\n     effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive,\n     including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2\n     and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation,\n     indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of\n     terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and\n     termination of this License will be without prejudice to any\n     other right or remedy of any party.\n\n12. Miscellaneous.\n\n12.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a \"commercial item\" as\n     defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data\n     rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily\n     provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary\n     commercial license in technical data and software is provided in\n     accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer\n     Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR\n     252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3\n     (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software\n     Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users\n     acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n\n12.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as\n     creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form\n     of legal association between or among You, Licensor or any\n     Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether\n     expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.\n\n12.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair\n     Licensor's right to acquire, license, develop, have others\n     develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products\n     that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise\n     compete with, Modifications, Derivative Works, technology or\n     products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.\n\n12.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Licensor or any Contributor to\n     enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver\n     of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or\n     regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall\n     be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.\n\n12.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent\n     jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion\n     thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will\n     be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the\n     economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of\n     this License will continue in full force and effect. (b)\n     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or\n     restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with\n     Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of\n     those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You\n     must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and\n     destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.\n\n12.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution\n     between You and Licensor relating to this License shall take\n     place in the Seattle, Washington, and You and Licensor hereby\n     consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state\n     and federal courts within that District with respect to this\n     License. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly\n     excluded.\n\n12.7 Export/Import Laws. This software is subject to all export and\n     import laws and restrictions and regulations of the country in\n     which you receive the Covered Code and You are solely responsible\n     for ensuring that You do not export, re-export or import the\n     Covered Code or any direct product thereof in violation of any\n     such restrictions, laws or regulations, or without all necessary\n     authorizations.\n\n12.8 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the\n     entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject\n     matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the\n     United States and the State of Washington.\n\nWhere You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following\nclause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested\nthat this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les\nparties ont exigÃ© que le prÃ©sent contrat et tous les documents\nconnexes soient rÃ©digÃ©s en anglais.\n\nEXHIBIT A.\n\n\"Copyright Â© 1995-2002 RealNetworks, Inc. and/or its licensors.

GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n    copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,\n    publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the\n    Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative\n    works, in source code and object code form.\n\n b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n    license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such\n    Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The\n    patent license granted by a Contributor shall also apply to the\n    combination of the Contribution of that Contributor and the\n    Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the\n    Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\n    combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent\n    license granted by a Contributor shall not apply to (i) any other\n    combinations which include the Contribution, nor to (ii)\n    Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is\n    licensed hereunder.\n\n c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other\n    entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for\n    claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\n    intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to\n    exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each\n    Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other\n    intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n    third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\n    distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to\n    acquire that license before distributing the Program.  Each\n    Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the\n    copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA. Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under\n   this Agreement or under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;\n \n b. if the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible\n    form, a copy of this Agreement or Distributor's own license\n    agreement is included with each copy of the Program; and\n\n c. if distributed under Distributor's own license agreement, such\n    license agreement:\n\n     i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n        warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n        warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n        implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and\n        fitness for a particular purpose;\n\n    ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all\n        liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n        incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n        and\n\n   iii. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement\n        are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other\n        party.\n\nB. Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous\nlocation in the Program:\n\n    Copyright (C) 2003, Lucent Technologies Inc. and others. All\n    Rights Reserved.\n\nC. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the\noriginator of its Contribution in a manner that reasonably allows\nsubsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the\nContribution. Also, each Contributor must agree that the additions\nand/or changes are intended to be a Contribution. Once a Contribution\nis contributed, it may not thereafter be revoked.  \n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain\nresponsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the\nlike. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use\nof the Program, the Distributor who includes the Program in a\ncommercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not\ncreate potential liability for Contributors. Therefore, if a\nDistributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,\nsuch Distributor (\"Commercial Distributor\") hereby agrees to defend\nand indemnify every Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against\nany losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from\nclaims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party\nagainst the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts\nor omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its\ndistribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The\nobligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\ninfringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)\npromptly notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim,\nand b) allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and cooperate with\nthe Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\nclaim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial\nDistributor. If that Commercial Distributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Distributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Distributor would have to\ndefend claims against the Contributors related to those performance\nclaims and warranties, and if a court requires any Contributor to pay\nany damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor must pay those\ndamages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\nPROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY\nWARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\nOR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely\nresponsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\ndistributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\nexercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to\nthe risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable\nlaws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and\nunavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\nANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\nINCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\nWITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\nLIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\nNEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR\nDISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED\nHEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. EXPORT CONTROL\n\nRecipient agrees that Recipient alone is responsible for compliance\nwith the United States export administration regulations (and the\nexport control laws and regulation of any other countries).\n\n8. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with\nrespect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or\ncounterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that\nContributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as\nof the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient\ninstitutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\ncross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\nitself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or\nhardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\nrights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\nlitigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably\npracticable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and\nany licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall\ncontinue and survive.\n\nLUCENT may publish new versions (including revisions) of this\nAgreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be\ngiven a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\nContributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\nAgreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new\nversion of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to\ndistribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new\nversion. No one other than LUCENT has the right to modify this\nAgreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,\nRecipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property\nof any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by\nimplication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\nexpressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and\nthe intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No\nparty to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement\nmore than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives\nits rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n",

The license\n  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,\n  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.\n\n  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG\n  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion\n  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products\n  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:\n\n    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be\n      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)\n\n    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or\n      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)\n\n    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use\n      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge\n      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the\n      FreeType code. (`credits')\n\n  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this\n  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.\n  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and\n  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.\n\n\n  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a\n  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus\n  encourage you to use the following text:\n\n   \"\"\"  \n    Portions of this software are copyright Â© <year> The FreeType\n    Project (www.freetype.org).

  "ZPLv1.3": " Zimbra Public License, Version 1.3 (ZPL)\n\nThis Zimbra Public License (this \"Agreement\") is a legal agreement\nthat describes the terms under which VMware, Inc., a Delaware\ncorporation having its principal place of business at 3401 Hillview\nAvenue, Palo Alto, California 94304 (\"VMware\") will provide software\nto you via download or otherwise (\"Software\"). By using the Software,\nyou, an individual or an entity (\"You\") agree to the terms of this\nAgreement.\n\nIn consideration of the mutual promises and upon the terms and\nconditions set forth below, the parties agree as follows:\n\n 1. Grant of Copyright License\n\n        1.1 - Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,\n        VMware hereby grants to You, under any and all of its\n        copyright interest in and to the Software, a royalty-free,\n        non-exclusive, non-transferable license to copy, modify,\n        compile, execute, and distribute the Software and\n        Modifications. For the purposes of this Agreement, any change\n        to, addition to, or abridgement of the Software made by You is\n        a \"Modification;\" however, any file You add to the Software\n        that does not contain any part of the Software is not a\n        \"Modification.\"\n\n        1.2 - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a\n        corporation or other entity, Your use of the Software or any\n        Modification is subject to Your having the authority to bind\n        such corporation or entity to this Agreement. Providing copies\n        to persons within such corporation or entity is not considered\n        distribution for purposes of this Agreement.\n\n        1.3 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in\n        source code format, You must do so only under the terms of\n        this Agreement, and You must include a complete copy of this\n        Agreement with Your distribution. With respect to any\n        Modification You distribute in source code format, the terms\n        of this Agreement will apply to You in the same way those\n        terms apply to VMware with respect to the Software. In other\n        words, when You are distributing Modifications under this\n        Agreement, You \"stand in the shoes\" of VMware in terms of the\n        rights You grant and how the terms and conditions apply to You\n        and the licensees of Your Modifications. Notwithstanding the\n        foregoing, when You \"stand in the shoes\" of VMware, You are\n        not subject to the jurisdiction provision under Section 7,\n        which requires all disputes under this Agreement to be subject\n        to the jurisdiction of federal or state courts of northern\n        California.\n\n        1.4 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in\n        compiled or object code format, You must also provide\n        recipients with access to the Software or Modification in\n        source code format along with a complete copy of this\n        Agreement. The distribution of the Software or Modifications\n        in compiled or object code format may be under a license of\n        Your choice, provided that You are in compliance with the\n        terms of this Agreement. In addition, You must make absolutely\n        clear that any license terms applying to such Software or\n        Modification that differ from this Agreement are offered by\n        You alone and not by VMware, and that such license does not\n        restrict recipients from exercising rights in the source code\n        to the Software granted by VMware under this Agreement or\n        rights in the source code to any Modification granted by You\n        as described in Section 1.3.\n\n        1.5 - This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute\n        files that are entirely Your own work (i.e., which do not\n        incorporate any portion of the Software and are not\n        Modifications) under any terms You choose.\n\n 2. Support\n\n        VMware has no obligation to provide technical support or\n        updates to You. Nothing in this Agreement requires VMware to\n        enter into any license with You for any other edition of the\n        Software.\n\n 3. Intellectual Property Rights\n\n        3.1 - Except for the license expressly granted under copyright\n        in Section 1.1, no rights, licenses or forbearances are\n        granted or may arise in relation to this Agreement whether\n        expressly, by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or\n        otherwise. All rights, including all intellectual property\n        rights, that are not expressly granted under this Agreement\n        are hereby reserved.\n\n        3.2 - In any copy of the Software or in any Modification you\n        create, You must retain and reproduce, any and all copyright,\n        patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are included\n        in the Software in the same form as they appear in the\n        Software. This includes the preservation of attribution\n        notices in the form of trademarks or logos that exist within a\n        user interface of the Software.\n\n        3.3 - This license does not grant You rights to use any\n        party's name, logo, or trademarks, except solely as necessary\n        to comply with Section 3.2.\n\n 4. Disclaimer of Warranties\n\n        THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n        KIND. VMWARE MAKES NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR\n        STATUTORY REGARDING OR RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE. SPECIFICALLY,\n        VMWARE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE\n        OR WILL PERFORM IN AN UNINTERRUPTED MANNER. TO THE GREATEST\n        EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, VMWARE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL\n        IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A\n        PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF VMWARE HAD BEEN INFORMED OF SUCH\n        PURPOSE), AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE,\n        ANY MODIFICATIONS THERETO AND WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE\n        FOREGOING.\n\n 5. Limitation of Liability\n\n        IN NO EVENT WILL VMWARE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\n        INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF\n        ANY KIND (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS\n        OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF COVER) IN\n        CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE\n        FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER\n        RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF\n        CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, AND EVEN\n        IF VMWARE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n 6. Term and Termination\n\n        6.1 - This Agreement will continue in effect unless and until\n        terminated earlier pursuant to this Section 6.\n\n        6.2 - In the event You violate the terms of this Agreement,\n        VMware may terminate this Agreement.\n\n        6.3 - All licenses granted hereunder shall terminate upon the\n        termination of this Agreement. Termination will be in addition\n        to any rights and remedies available to VMware at law or\n        equity or under this Agreement.\n\n        6.4 - Termination of this Agreement will not affect the\n        provisions regarding reservation of rights (Section 3.1),\n        provisions disclaiming or limiting VMware's liability\n        (Sections 4 and 5), Termination (Section 6) or Miscellaneous\n        (Section 7), which provisions will survive termination of this\n        Agreement.\n\n 7. Miscellaneous\n\n        This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties\n        with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and\n        supersedes all previous communications, representations,\n        understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between\n        the parties with respect to said subject matter. The\n        relationship of the parties hereunder is that of independent\n        contractors, and this Agreement will not be construed as\n        creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other\n        form of legal association between the parties. If any term,\n        condition, or provision in this Agreement is found to be\n        invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, this\n        Agreement will be construed in a manner that most closely\n        effectuates the intent of this Agreement. Such invalid term,\n        condition or provision will be severed from the remaining\n        terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue to be\n        valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by\n        law. This Agreement will be interpreted and construed in\n        accordance with the laws of the State of California and the\n        United States of America, without regard to conflict of law\n        principles. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the\n        International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this\n        Agreement. All disputes arising out of this Agreement\n        involving VMware or any of its subsidiaries shall be subject\n        to the jurisdiction of the federal or state courts of northern\n        California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\n        California. No rights may be assigned, no obligations may be\n        delegated, and this Agreement may not be transferred by You,\n        in whole or in part, whether voluntary or by operation of law,\n        including by way of sale of assets, merger or consolidation,\n        without the prior written consent of VMware, and any purported\n        assignment, delegation or transfer without such consent shall\n        be void ab initio. Any waiver of the provisions of this\n        Agreement or of a party's rights or remedies under this\n        Agreement must be in writing to be effective. Failure, neglect\n        or delay by a party to enforce the provisions of this\n        Agreement or its rights or remedies at any time, will not be\n        construed or be deemed to be a waiver of such party's rights\n        under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the\n        validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or\n        prejudice such party's right to take subsequent action.\n",

  "LPPLv1.2": " The LaTeX Project Public License\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nLPPL Version 1.2  1999-09-03\n\nCopyright 1999 LaTeX3 Project\n    Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this\n    license document, but modification of it is not allowed.\n\n\nPREAMBLE\n========\n\nThe LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the\nbase LaTeX distribution is distributed.\n\nYou may use this license for any program that you have written and wish\nto distribute.  This license may be particularly suitable if your\nprogram is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it\neven if your program is unrelated to TeX.  The section `WHETHER AND HOW\nTO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE', below, gives instructions,\nexamples, and recommendations for authors who are considering\ndistributing their programs under this license.\n\nIn this license document, `The Program' refers to any program\ndistributed under this license.\n\nThis license gives conditions under which The Program may be distributed\nand conditions under which modified versions of The Program may be\ndistributed.  Individual files of The Program may bear supplementary\nand/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the\ndistribution of modified versions of themselves, but *no* file of The\nProgram may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the\ndistribution of an unmodified copy of the file.  A distributor wishing\nto distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program therefore\nneeds to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else.\n\nActivities other than distribution and/or modification of The Program\nare not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In\nparticular, the act of running The Program is not restricted.\n\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you\nthe freedom to make and distribute modified versions of The Program\nthat conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while\nmaintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of\nThe Program.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while \nmeeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'\nin the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\n\n\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n===========================================\n\nYou may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of The Program.\nDistribution of only part of The Program is not allowed.\n\nYou may not modify in any way a file of The Program that bears a legal\nnotice forbidding modification of that file.\n\nYou may distribute a modified file of The Program if, and only if, the\nfollowing eight conditions are met:\n\n  1. You must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the\n     distribution of a modified version of the file as described below\n     in the subsection `Additional Conditions on Individual Files of\n     The Program'.\n \n  2. If the file is a LaTeX software file, then you must meet any\n     applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified\n     version of the file that are described below in the subsection\n     `Additional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files'.\n \n  3. You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the\n     original file.\n \n  4. In the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and\n     name of the original file, and the name (if any) of the program\n     which contains it.\n \n  5. You must change any identification string in the file to indicate\n     clearly that the modified file is not part of The Program.\n \n  6. You must change any addresses in the modified file for the\n     reporting of errors in the file or in The Program generally to\n     ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original\n     maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified\n     files.\n \n  7. You must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids\n     distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived\n     from the modified file with the filename of the original file.\n \n  8. You must do either (A) or (B):\n\n       (A) distribute a copy of The Program (that is, a complete,\n           unmodified copy of The Program) together with the modified\n           file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by\n           offering access to copy the modified file from a designated\n           place, then offering equivalent access to copy The Program\n           from the same place meets this condition, even though third\n           parties are not compelled to copy The Program along with the\n           modified file;\n\n       (B) provide to those who receive the modified file information\n           that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of The Program;\n           for example, you may provide a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)\n           for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of \n           The Program free of charge (either the version from which\n           your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version).\n\nNote that in the above, `distribution' of a file means making the\nfile available to others by any means.  This includes, for instance,\ninstalling the file on any machine in such a way that the file is\naccessible by users other than yourself.  `Modification' of a file\nmeans any procedure that produces a derivative file under any\napplicable law -- that is, a file containing the original file or\na significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\nand/or translated into another language.\n\nChanging the name of a file (other than as necessitated by the file\nconventions of the target file systems) is considered to be a\nmodification of the file.\n\nThe distribution conditions in this license do not have to be\napplied to files that have been modified in accordance with the\nabove conditions.  Note, however, that Condition 7. does apply to\nany such modified file.\n\nThe conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not\napply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes\nidentical to the latest version of that file of The Program.\n\n \n\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is wise never to modify a file of The Program, even for your own\npersonal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for\ndistributing the modified file.  While you might intend that such\nmodified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by\naccident -- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may\nnot occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file\nthat you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of\nthis license.  It is usually in your best interest to keep your copy\nof The Program identical with the public one.  Many programs provide\nways to control the behavior of that program without altering its\nlicensed files.\n\n\nAdditional Conditions on Individual Files of The Program\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn individual file of The Program may bear additional conditions that\nsupplement and/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only\nif, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the\nfile or distribution of a modified version of the file.  The conditions\non individual files of The Program therefore may differ only with\nrespect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that\nis allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions\nof those files.\n\n\nAdditional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is,\nif it is a LaTeX software file), then the following additional\nconditions, which supplement and/or supersede the conditions\nabove, apply to the file according to its filename extension:\n\n  - You may not modify any file with filename extension `.ins' since\n    these are installation files containing the legal notices that are\n    placed in the files they generate.\n \n  - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename\n    extension `.fd' (LaTeX font definition files) under the standard\n    conditions of the LPPL as described above.  You may also distribute\n    such modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names\n    provided that:\n    (1) the only changes to the original files either enable use of\n        available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;\n    (2) you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input\n        paths can be used to control which set of LaTeX font definition\n        files is actually used by TeX).\n\n  - You may distribute modified versions of files with filename\n    extension `.cfg' (configuration files) with their original names.\n    The Program may (and usually will) specify the range of commands\n    that are allowed in a particular configuration file.\n \nBecause of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software,\nThe LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of\ncomponents of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them,\nbut such distribution can meet the conditions of this license.\n\n\nNO WARRANTY\n===========\n\nThere is no warranty for The Program.  Except when otherwise stated in\nwriting, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is', without\nwarranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not\nlimited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for\na particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance\nof The Program is with you.  Should The Program prove defective, you\nassume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\n\nIn no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or\nany author named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may\ndistribute and/or modify The Program as permitted above, be liable to\nyou for damages, including any general, special, incidental or\nconsequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of\ninability to use The Program (including, but not limited to, loss of\ndata, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as\na result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other\nprograms), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other\nparty has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMS UNDER THIS LICENSE\n=========================================================\n\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and\nrecommendations for authors who are considering distributing their\nprograms under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in\nthis section.\n\n\nChoosing This License or Another License\n----------------------------------------\n\nIf for any part of your program you want or need to use *distribution*\nconditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to\nthis license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your\nprogram under a different license.  You may use the text of this license\nas a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to\nthe LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your program is\ndistributed under the LPPL.\n\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains\nthe motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,\nfor example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public\nLicense (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your program is\nunrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be\nrelevant, and authors intending to distribute their programs under any\nlicense are encouraged to read it.\n\n\nHow to Use This License\n-----------------------\n\nTo use this license, place in each of the files of your program both\nan explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also\na statement that the distribution and/or modification of the file is\nconstrained by the conditions in this license.\n\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\n\n  %% pig.dtx\n  %% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name\n  %\n  % This program may be distributed and/or modified under the\n  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.2\n  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\n  % The latest version of this license is in\n  %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt\n  % and version 1.2 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX \n  % version 1999/12/01 or later.\n  %\n  % This program consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\n\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in\nthis license document would apply, with `The Program' referring to the\ntwo files `pig.dtx' and `pig.ins', and `The Copyright Holder' referring\nto the person `M. Y. Name'.\n\n\nImportant Recommendations\n-------------------------\n\n Defining What Constitutes The Program\n\n   The LPPL requires that distributions of The Program contain all the\n   files of The Program.  It is therefore important that you provide a\n   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute The Program.\n   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the\n   files of The Program near the copyright notice of each file or by\n   using a line like\n\n    % This program consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\n\n   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be\n   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you\n   to comprise The Program.\n\n Noting Exceptional Files\n  \n   If The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on\n   modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those\n   files (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX\n   Software Files'), then it is recommended that The Program contain a\n   prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either\n   lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of\n   exceptional files.\n\n   Files containing the text of a license (such as this file) are\n   often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on\n   modification.  LaTeX configuration files (with filename extension\n   `.cfg') are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions\n   on the distribution of a modified version of the file.  The\n   additional conditions on LaTeX software given above are examples \n   of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional\n   conditions.\n",

Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.\n\n## Using Creative Commons Public Licenses\n\nCreative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n### Considerations for licensors\n\nOur public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.\n\n### Considerations for the public\n\nBy using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensorâ€™s permission is not necessary for any reasonâ€“for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyrightâ€“then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.\n\n## The license itself\n\nBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n### Section 1 â€“ Definitions\n\n1. **Adapted Material** means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n2. **Adapter's License** means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n3. **Copyright and Similar Rights** means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(2)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n4. **Effective Technological Measures** means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\n5. **Exceptions and Limitations** means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n6. **Licensed Material** means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\n7.  **Licensed Rights** means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n8. **Licensor** means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\n9. **Share** means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\n10. **Sui Generis Database Rights** means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n11. **You** means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n### Section 2 â€“ Scope\n\n1. **License grant**\n   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n      1. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n      2. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n    2. _Exceptions and Limitations_. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n    3. _Term_. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(1).\n    4. _Media and formats; technical modifications allowed_. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(1)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n    5. _Downstream recipients_\n       1. Offer from the Licensor â€“ Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n       2. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n    6. _No endorsement_. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(1)(1)(1)(9).\n\t   \n2. **Other rights**\n   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n### Section 3 â€“ License Conditions\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\n1. **Attribution**\n   1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n      1. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n         1. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n         2. a copyright notice;\n         3. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n         4. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n         5. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n      2. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n      3. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(1)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(1)(1)(1) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n   4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n### Section 4 â€“ Sui Generis Database Rights\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n1. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(1)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n2. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n3. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(1) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n### Section 5 â€“ Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability\n\n1. **Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.**\n2. **To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.**\n3. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n### Section 6 â€“ Term and Termination\n\n1. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\n2. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(1), it reinstates:\n   1.  automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n   2.  upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(2) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n3.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n4.  Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n### Section 7 â€“ Other Terms and Conditions\n\n1. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n2. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n### Section 8 â€“ Interpretation\n\n1. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n2. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n3. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n4. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n## Creative Commons\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

  "EPLv1.0": " Eclipse Public License - v 1.0\n\nTHE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE\nPUBLIC LICENSE (\"AGREEMENT\"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF\nTHE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n     documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n\n  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n\n    i) changes to the Program, and\n\n    ii) additions to the Program;\n\nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and\nare distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such\nContributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's\nbehalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:\n(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with\nthe Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not\nderivative works of the Program.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor\nwhich are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution\nalone or when combined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\nAgreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this\nAgreement, including all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n     copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,\n     publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the\n     Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative\n     works, in source code and object code form.\n\n  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n     license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n     import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such\n     Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This\n     patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution\n     and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the\n     Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\n     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent\n     license shall not apply to any other combinations which include\n     the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\n  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n     licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n     provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe\n     the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other\n     entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for\n     claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\n     intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to\n     exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each\n     Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other\n     intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n     third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\n     distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to\n     acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\n  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n     sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n     the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form\nunder its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\n  b) its license agreement:\n\n    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n       warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n       warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n       implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n       for a particular purpose;\n\n    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all\n        liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n        incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement\n         are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other\n         party; and\n\n    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\n        reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for\n        software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\n  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\nwithin the Program.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\nContribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\nRecipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain\nresponsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the\nlike. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use\nof the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a\ncommercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not\ncreate potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a\nContributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,\nsuch Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend\nand indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\")\nagainst any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising\nfrom claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party\nagainst the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts\nor omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its\ndistribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The\nobligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\ninfringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)\npromptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,\nand b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with\nthe Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\nclaim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those\nperformance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\nContributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor\nmust pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\nPROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY\nWARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\nOR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely\nresponsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\ndistributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\nexercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to\nthe risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable\nlaws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and\nunavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\nANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\nINCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\nWITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\nLIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\nNEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR\nDISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED\nHEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nthe Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other\nsoftware or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such\nRecipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of\nthe date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably\npracticable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and\nany licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall\ncontinue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\nmay only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\nreserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\nthis Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\nSteward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\nis the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign\nthe responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable\nseparate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a\ndistinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)\nmay always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\nunder which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the\nAgreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the\nProgram (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as\nexpressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives\nno rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor\nunder this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or\notherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this\nAgreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and\nthe intellectual property laws of the United States of America.

  "GPLv2orlater": " GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 2, June 1991\n\n Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n",
  "OpenContentLicensev1.0": " OpenContent License (OPL)\nVersion 1.0, July 14, 1998.\n\nThis document outlines the principles underlying the OpenContent (OC)\nmovement and may be redistributed provided it remains unaltered.

You may copy and distribute exact replicas of the OpenContent (OC)\nas you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\nLicense and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\nrecipients of the OC a copy of this License along with the OC. You may\nat your option charge a fee for the media and/or handling involved in\ncreating a unique copy of the OC for use offline, you may at your\noption offer instructional support for the OC in exchange for a fee,\nor you may at your option offer warranty in exchange for a fee. You\nmay not charge a fee for the OC itself. You may not charge a fee for\nthe sole service of providing access to and/or use of the OC via a\nnetwork (e.g. the Internet), whether it be via the world wide web,\nFTP, or any other method.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the OpenContent or any\nportion of it, thus forming works based on the Content, and distribute\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,\nprovided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified content to carry prominent notices\n   stating that you changed it, the exact nature and content of the\n   changes, and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n   whole or in part contains or is derived from the OC or any part\n   thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n   parties under the terms of this License, unless otherwise permitted\n   under applicable Fair Use law.\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.

  "GPLv3_with_exception": " GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n",
  "GFDLv1.2orlater": " GNU Free Documentation License\n                  Version 1.2, November 2002\n\n\n Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\n0. PREAMBLE\n\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\nfunctional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to\nassure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,\nwith or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.\nSecondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\nto get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible\nfor modifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative\nworks of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\nlicense designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\ndistributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\nwork under the conditions stated herein.  The \"Document\", below,\nrefers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a\nlicensee, and is addressed as \"you\".  You accept the license if you\ncopy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission\nunder copyright law.\n\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\nmodifications and/or translated into another language.\n\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\nthe Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject\n(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\nwithin that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a\ntextbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\nmathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\nthem.\n\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.  If a\nsection does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not\nallowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero\nInvariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant\nSections then there are none.\n\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed,\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may\nbe at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the\ngeneral public, that is suitable for revising the document\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\nfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\nto text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\nformat whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\nor discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\nAn image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount\nof text.  A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\nor XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\nHTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of\ntransparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats\ninclude proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by\nproprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or\nprocessing tools are not generally available, and the\nmachine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word\nprocessors for output purposes only.\n\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\nplus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\nthis License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\nformats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\npreceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose\ntitle either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\ntext that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\nspecific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\",\n\"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".)  To \"Preserve the Title\"\nof such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\nsection \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\n\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\nstates that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty\nDisclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this\nLicense, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\nimplication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has\nno effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\nconditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\nyou may publicly display copies.\n\n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\nprinted covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\nDocument's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the\ncopies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\nthe back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\nyou as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\nthe full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\nvisible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\nthe title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\nas verbatim copying in other respects.\n\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\npages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\na computer-network location from which the general network-using\npublic has access to download using public-standard network protocols\na complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.\nIf you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,\nwhen you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure\nthat this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\nlocation until at least one year after the last time you distribute an\nOpaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that\nedition to the public.\n\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\nthem a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\nthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\nthe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\nVersion filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\nand modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\nof it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\n   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\n   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\n   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\n   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\n   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\n   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),\n   unless they release you from this requirement.\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\n   Modified Version, as the publisher.\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\n   adjacent to the other copyright notices.\nF. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\n   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\n   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\n   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\nI. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add\n   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\n   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\n   there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one\n   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\n   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\n   Version as stated in the previous sentence.\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\n   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\n   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\n   it was based on.  These may be placed in the \"History\" section.\n   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\n   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\n   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\nK. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\",\n   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all\n   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\n   and/or dedications given therein.\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\n   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\n   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\nM. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\".  Such a section\n   may not be included in the Modified Version.\nN. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\"\n   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\nappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\ncopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\nof these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\nlist of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\nThese titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\nnothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\nparties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\nbeen approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\nstandard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\npassage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\nof Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\nFront-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\nthrough arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\nincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\nby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\nyou may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\npermission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\ngive permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\nInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\nlicense notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by\nadding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\nauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\nMake the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\nInvariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\"\nin the various original documents, forming one section Entitled\n\"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\nand any sections Entitled \"Dedications\".  You must delete all sections\nEntitled \"Endorsements\".\n\n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\nreleased under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\nLicense in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\nthe collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\nverbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\nit individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\nLicense into the extracted document, and follow this License in all\nother respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n\n\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\nand independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright\nresulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights\nof the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.\nWhen the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not\napply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\nderivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\nthe entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\ncovers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\nOtherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole\naggregate.\n\n\n8. TRANSLATION\n\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\ndistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\nReplacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\npermission from their copyright holders, but you may include\ntranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\noriginal versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\ntranslation of this License, and all the license notices in the\nDocument, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\nthe original English version of this License and the original versions\nof those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between\nthe translation and the original version of this License or a notice\nor disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\n\"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\nits Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual\ntitle.\n\n\n9. TERMINATION\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except\nas expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to\ncopy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,\nparties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions\nof the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\nIf the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this\nLicense \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that specified version or\nof any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\nFree Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\nas a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\nthe License in the document and put the following copyright and\nlicense notices just after the title page:\n\n    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\n    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\n    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2\n    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\n    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\n    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU\n    Free Documentation License\".\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\nreplace the \"with...Texts.\" line with this:\n\n    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\n    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other\ncombination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the\nsituation.\n\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\nrecommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of\nfree software license, such as the GNU General Public License,\nto permit their use in free software.\n",
  "LGPLv2orlater": " GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 2, June 1991\n\n Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is\n numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\nother libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\nyour libraries, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\nyou distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\nwith the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\nthe library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nlibrary.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\nversion, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\nthe original authors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\nsoftware will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\ntransforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\nwe have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\nfree use or not licensed at all.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\nGNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\nlicense, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\ndesignated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\none; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\nthe same as in the ordinary license.\n\n  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\nthey blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\nprogram and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\nchanging the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\nanalogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\na textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\nderivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\ntreats it as such.\n\n  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\nPublic License for libraries did not effectively promote software\nsharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\nconcluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n\n  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\nusers of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\nlibraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\npermit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\npreserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\nlibraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\nthis as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\nchanges in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\nwill lead to faster development of free libraries.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\nworks together with the library.\n\n  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\nGeneral Public License rather than by this special one.\n\n                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\nparty saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\nGeneral Public License (also called \"this License\").  Each licensee is\naddressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n  \n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\ndistributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

  "GPLv2_with_exception": " GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 2, June 1991\n\n Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.

Thus, as an example, the LICENSEE is\nforbidden from seeking patents for the PROGRAM or registering the name\nor any other distinctive sign of it before the INPI.\n\n8.GENERAL RIGHTS OF THE LICENSOR\n\n8.1.The LICENSOR retains author rights to claim the paternity of the\nPROGRAM, according to what is set forth in Law 9.609/98, in article 2,\nparagraph 1 .\n\n8.2.It is also the right of the LICENSOR to have all the conventional\nsigns indicating his authorship, placed by him or at his request, kept\nthe same way as originally placed. This right is extended also to\nderived computer programs.\n\n8.3.However, the LICENSOR may, at any time, request the removal of all\nthe conventional signs indicating his authorship, placed by him or at\nhis request, of a computer program derived from the PROGRAM when he\njudges that the alterations performed may damage his honor or\nreputation.\n\n9.GENERAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE LICENSOR\n\n9.1.The LICENSOR must always DISTRIBUTE the PROGRAM in two formats,\nnamely, compiled and source-code, having observed the dispositions of\nitem 12.1, below.\n\n9.2.The LICENSOR may never revoke any right given hereby; he also may\nnot alter the rights of any previous versions of the PROGRAM already\nlicensed.\n\n9.3.It is the obligation of the LICENSOR, to ensure that the PROGRAM\nmay be distributed according to this LICENSE, to waive the right to\nobject to alterations to the PROGRAM. He may, in the event that he\ndisagrees with the alterations performed in computer programs derived\nfrom the PROGRAM, request the elimination of his distinctive signs\nplaced on the derived program, according to item 8.3, above.\n\n10.USE OF THE PROGRAM\n\n10.1.The USE of the PROGRAM is allowed for all interested persons,\nprovided the terms of this LICENSE are respected.\n\n10.1.1.By USE it is to be understood: the employment of the PROGRAM\nunder normal conditions, in accordance to what is described in its\ntechnical documentation.\n\n10.1.2.The USE can also relate to the source-code form of the PROGRAM,\nwhich purpose is to make public the structure of the compiled form of\nthe program, as well as to allow the development of new derived\ncomputer programs or programs that use part of the PROGRAM.\n\n10.2.There are no restrictions to USE of the PROGRAM for commercial\nactivities of the LICENSEE, as long as the terms of this LICENSE are\nrespected, notably the obligations of item 7, above.\n\n10.3.In the event that parts of the PROGRAM are used in other computer\nprograms, these must necessarily be licensed by this LICENSE. As an\nexception to this rule, the computer program that uses parts of the\nPROGRAM may be licensed in a different way provided its normal\nfunctioning is independent of the copied part and the latter is\naccompanied by its source-code form.\n\n10.4.Regarding works derived from the PROGRAM, it is understood, for\nall purposes, that the LICENSOR is the author of the derivations.\n\n11.PUBLICATION OF THE PROGRAM\n\n11.1.The LICENSEE may freely PUBLISH the PROGRAM, in any medium and\nfor any purpose.\n\n11.2.Any PUBLICATION OF the PROGRAM shall be accompanied by a complete\ncopy of this LICENSE, which is an integral part of the PROGRAM, in\naccordance with article 9 of Law 9.609/98.\n\n11.3.When it is in source-code format, the PROGRAM must contain, at\nthe beginning of all text files integrating it, reference to this\nLICENSE, which must be done in the following manner:\n\nBEGIN COMMENT MARKER\n\nThis program is licensed in accordance with the GPL-PA (GENERAL PUBLIC\nLICENSE FOR COMPUTER PROGRAMS OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION), version\n1.1 or any later version.\n\nThe GPL-PA shall accompany all PUBLICATION, DISTRIBUTION and\nREPRODUCTION of this PROGRAM.\n\nIn the event that a copy of the GPL-PA is not available together with\nthis Program, you may contact the LICENSOR or directly access:\n\nhttp://www.celepar.pr.gov.br/licenca/LPG-AP.pdf\n\nIn order to USE, PUBLISH, DISTRIBUTE, REPRODUCE or ALTER the PROGRAM\nit is necessary to agree with the terms of the GPL-PA .\n\nEND COMMENT MARKER 11.4.In the event that the PROGRAM is a collective\nwork, according to what was specified in item13, article 88 of the Law\n9610/98 will not apply to the PUBLICATION.\n\n12.DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\n\n12.1.The rights of DISTRIBUTION of the PROGRAM apply to the compiled\nand source-code forms. The LICENSEE may distribute the program\nconcomitantly in the two forms mentioned (compiled and source-code) or\neven with a valid offer of distribution of both forms, following the\nterms below.\n\n12.2.The partial DISTRIBUTION of the PROGRAM, which includes only the\nsource-code or only the compiled form, is forbidden. Thus, the\nDISTRIBUTION must obey one of the following options:\n\n12.2.1.Include the complete compiled form and the source-code form,\nwhich shall be distributed in a medium or media habitually used to\nexchange software; or,\n\n12.2.2.Include the compiled form and a written offer, with at least a\nthree-year validity, to provide any interested person, for a cost\nwhich can not be superior to that of the distribution, a complete copy\nof the corresponding source-code form, in a medium or media usually\nused for exchanging software; or,\n\n12.2.3.Include the compiled form and the information received by the\nLICENSEE regarding the offer to distribute the corresponding\nsource-code. (This alternative is allowed only for non-commercial\ndistribution and only if the program has been received in its compiled\nform accompanied by this offer, according with item 12.2.2, above).\n\n12.3.Any DISTRIBUTION of the PROGRAM shall be accompanied by a copy of\nthis LICENSE.\n\n12.4.There is no restrictioin to the DISTRIBUTION of the PROGRAM for\ncommercial purposes, if it is clear that there will be no charges for\nthe PROGRAM, but only for the means and services of distribution.\n\n13.REPRODUCTION OF THE PROGRAM\n\n13.1.There are no restrictions regarding the number of copies of the\nPROGRAM that the LICENSEE can make. Its REPRODUCTION is free in any\nmedium, but it should respect the restrictions on item 11, according\nto the destination of each REPRODUCTION.\n\n13.2.Any REPRODUCTION of the PROGRAM must be accompanied by a copy of\nthis LICENSE, according to item 12.3, above.\n\n14.ALTERATION OF THE PROGRAM\n\n14.1.The LICENSEE is allowed to make alterations to the PROGRAM. Any\nALTERATION, however, must be identified and acknowledged in the\nsource-code, for purposes of identification of authorship.\n\n14.2.It is forbidden to make alterations in the credits and\ndistinctive signs placed by the LICENSOR and by any author of\noriginating versions, except when allowed explicitly by the LICENSOR.\n\n14.3.The COMPUTER PROGRAMS resulting from the alteration of the\nPROGRAM will also be subjected to this LICENSE, whether it is a new\nprogram or only a new version of the PROGRAM.\n\n14.4.The authors of the PROGRAM will be able to use other forms of\nlicensing for their contribution part, if it may be used separately,\naccording to article 15, paragraph 2 of Law 9.610/98.\n\n14.5.A PROGRAM that is subject to the GPLâ€“PA will always have a\nreference to this LICENSE and to its address on the Internet (URL) in\na place that is easily accessed by users of the PROGRAM.\n\n14.6.In the cases in which the PROGRAM has the participation of\ndifferent people for its preparation, the aforementioned will be\nconsidered a collective work in the terms of article 5,Vlll, h of Law\n9610/98.the ownership rights are retained under the responsibility of\nthe organizer- in the present case, the LICENSOR.\n\n14.7.The inclusion of contributions of third parties in the collective\nwork hereby licensed, when described in this manner, is assumed to be\nfree of charge. Authors other than the organizer of the collective\nwork abdicate their ownership rights over it, as well as the right\nforeseen in article 88, ll of Law 9.610/98,referring to the\npublication of the names of all the participants of the work.\n\n15.ATTACHEMENTS TO THIS LICENSE\n\n15.1.This LICENSE does not allow any alteration in its content, not\neven for validating its integrity. However, as an alternative for\nsmall adaptations or additions, it accepts attachments in separate\nfiles, provided they have been approved by the LICENSOR.\n\n15.2.Such attachments cannot, under any circumstance, conflict with\nthe content of this license, and any such contrary dispositions shall\nbe null and void.\n\n15.3.When the LICENSE is accompanied by attachments, these will be\nconsidered a part of the LICENSE and must accompany all subsequent\nlicensing.\n\n16.TERM\n\n16.1.The present instrument will be valid for the period of 50 (fifty)\nyears, in the terms of article 2, paragraph 2, of Law 9.609/98.\n\n17.CESSATION OF LICENCING\n\n17.1.The lack of observance of any of the clauses of this license will\nresult in the immediate cessation of all rights of the LICENSEE over\nthe PROGRAM, without the need for denouncing this text.\n\nNEW VERSIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\n17.2.The current version of this LICENSE, along with the previous\nones, shall be available at\n[http://www.celepar.pr.gov.br/licenca/LPG-AP.pdf].\n\n17.3.The redistribution of this PROGRAM may be carried out using the\nversion of this LICENSE that accompanies it, or the most recent\navailable version at the address cited above.\n\n17.4.The new versions of the LICENSE cannot, however, under any\ncircumstance, withdraw rights already guaranteed for any of the\nparties in the version in force when accepted.\n\n18.VENUE\n\n18.1.The parties choose the forum of the judiciary district or\nheadquarters of the holder of author rights of the PROGRAM as venue,\nrenouncing any other, regardless of how privileged it may be, in order\nto resolve questions arising form the present instrument which cannot\nbe resolved extrajudicially or administratively.\n\nI.

The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4.

  "LGPLv2": " GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 2, June 1991\n\n Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is\n numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\nother libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\nyour libraries, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\nyou distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\nwith the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\nthe library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nlibrary.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\nversion, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\nthe original authors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\nsoftware will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\ntransforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\nwe have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\nfree use or not licensed at all.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\nGNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\nlicense, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\ndesignated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\none; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\nthe same as in the ordinary license.\n\n  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\nthey blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\nprogram and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\nchanging the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\nanalogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\na textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\nderivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\ntreats it as such.\n\n  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\nPublic License for libraries did not effectively promote software\nsharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\nconcluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n\n  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\nusers of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\nlibraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\npermit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\npreserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\nlibraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\nthis as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\nchanges in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\nwill lead to faster development of free libraries.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\nworks together with the library.\n\n  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\nGeneral Public License rather than by this special one.\n\n                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\nparty saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\nGeneral Public License (also called \"this License\").  Each licensee is\naddressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n  \n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\ndistributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Library General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n",

  "LGPL-LR": " Lesser General Public License For Linguistic Resources\n\n\t\t\tPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most data are designed to take away your freedom to \nshare and change it. By contrast, this License is intended to guarantee \nyour freedom to share and change free data--to make sure the data are \nfree for all their users.\n\nThis License, the Lesser General Public License for Linguistic Resources, \napplies to some specially designated linguistic resources -- typically \nlexicons and grammars.\n\n\n\tTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any Linguistic Resource which contains \na notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it \nmay be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License for \nLinguistic Resources (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is \naddressed as \"you\".\n\nA \"linguistic resource\" means a collection of data about language prepared \nso as to be used with application programs.\n\nThe \"Linguistic Resource\", below, refers to any such work which has been \ndistributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Linguistic Resource\" means \neither the Linguistic Resource or any derivative work under copyright law: that \nis to say, a work containing the Linguistic Resource or a portion of it, either \nverbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another \nlanguage. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \n\"modification\".)\n\n\"Legible form\" for a linguistic resource means the preferred form of the resource \nfor making modifications to it.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by \nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the \nLinguistic Resource is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered \nonly if its contents constitute a work based on the Linguistic Resource \n(independent of the use of the Linguistic Resource in a tool for writing it). \nWhether that is true depends on what the program that uses the Linguistic \nResource does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Linguistic Resource as you \nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately \npublish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; \nkeep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any \nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Linguistic Resource.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at \nyour option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Linguistic Resource or any portion \nof it, thus forming a work based on the Linguistic Resource, and copy and distribute \nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you \nalso meet all of these conditions:\n\n      a) The modified work must itself be a linguistic resource.\n      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that \n      you changed the files and the date of any change.\n      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all \n      third parties under the terms of this License.\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections \nof that work are not derived from the Linguistic Resource, and can be reasonably \nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and \nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate \nworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work \nbased on the Linguistic Resource, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms \nof this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, \nand thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to \nwork written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control \nthe distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Linguistic Resource.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Linguistic Resource \nwith the Linguistic Resource (or with a work based on the Linguistic Resource) on a \nvolume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the \nscope of this License.\n\n3. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Linguistic Resource, \nbut is designed to work with the Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted form of the \nLinguistic Resource) by reading it or being compiled or linked with it, is called \na \"work that uses the Linguistic Resource\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a \nderivative work of the Linguistic Resource, and therefore falls outside the scope \nof this License.\n\nHowever, combining a \"work that uses the Linguistic Resource\" with the Linguistic \nResource (or an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource) creates a package that \nis a derivative of the Linguistic Resource (because it contains portions of the \nLinguistic Resource), rather than a \"work that uses the Linguistic Resource\". If \nthe package is a derivative of the Linguistic Resource, you may distribute the \npackage under the terms of Section 4. Any works containing that package also \nfall under Section 4.\n\n4. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine a \"work that uses \nthe Linguistic Resource\" with the Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted form of the \nLinguistic Resource) to produce a package containing portions of the Linguistic \nResource, and distribute that package under terms of your choice, provided that \nthe terms permit modification of the package for the customer's own use and reverse \nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the package that the Linguistic \nResource is used in it and that the Linguistic Resource and its use are covered by \nthis License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the package during execution \ndisplays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Linguistic \nResource among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this \nLicense. Also, you must do one of these things:\n\n      a) Accompany the package with the complete corresponding machine-readable \n      legible form of the Linguistic Resource including whatever changes were used \n      in the package (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, \n      if the package contains an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource, with the \n      complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Linguistic Resource\", as object \n      code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Linguistic Resource \n      and then encrypt it to produce a modified package containing the modified \n      Linguistic Resource.\n      b) Use a suitable mechanism for combining with the Linguistic Resource. A \n      suitable mechanism is one that will operate properly with a modified version \n      of the Linguistic Resource, if the user installs one, as long as the modified \n      version is interface-compatible with the version that the package was made with.\n      c) Accompany the package with a written offer, valid for at least three years, \n      to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 4a, above, for a \n      charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n      d) If distribution of the package is made by offering access to copy from a \n      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials \n      from the same place.\n      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or \n      that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\nIf the package includes an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource, the required form \nof the \"work that uses the Linguistic Resource\" must include any data and utility \nprograms needed for reproducing the package from it. However, as a special exception, \nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed \n(in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) \nof the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself \naccompanies the executable.\n\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of proprietary \nlibraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means \nyou cannot use both them and the Linguistic Resource together in a package that you distribute.\n\n5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Linguistic Resource \nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, \nsublicense, link with, or distribute the Linguistic Resource is void, and will automatically \nterminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, \nfrom you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties \nremain in full compliance.\n\n6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing \nelse grants you permission to modify or distribute the Linguistic Resource or its derivative \nworks. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by \nmodifying or distributing the Linguistic Resource (or any work based on the Linguistic Resource), \nyou indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for \ncopying, distributing or modifying the Linguistic Resource or works based on it.\n\n7. Each time you redistribute the Linguistic Resource (or any work based on the Linguistic \nResource), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, \ndistribute, link with or modify the Linguistic Resource subject to these terms and conditions. \nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted \nherein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any \nother reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court \norder, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not \nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy \nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then \nas a consequence you may not distribute the Linguistic Resource at all. For example, if a \npatent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Linguistic Resource by \nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could \nsatisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the \nLinguistic Resource.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular \ncircumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is \nintended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property \nright claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of \nprotecting the integrity of the free resource distribution system which is implemented by public \nlicense practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of data \ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up \nto the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute resources through any other \nsystem and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of \nthe rest of this License.\n\n9. If the distribution and/or use of the Linguistic Resource is restricted in certain countries \neither by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the \nLinguistic Resource under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation \nexcluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not \nthus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the \nbody of this License.\n\n10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General \nPublic License for Linguistic Resources from time to time. Such new versions will be similar \nin spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Linguistic Resource specifies a \nversion number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the \noption of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version \npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Linguistic Resource does not specify a license \nversion number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Linguistic Resource into other free programs whose \ndistribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission.\n\n\n\t\t\tNO WARRANTY\n\n12. BECAUSE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE \nLINGUISTIC RESOURCE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN \nWRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE \"AS IS\" \nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE \nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK \nAS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LINGUISTIC \nRESOURCE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT \nHOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE AS \nPERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR \nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE \n(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED \nBY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER \nSOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\tEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n",

THE LICENSOR GRANTS\nYOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF\nSUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\n1. Definitions\n\n    \"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue,\n    anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in\n    unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,\n    constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are\n    assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a\n    Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as\n    defined below) for the purposes of this License.\n\n    \"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the\n    Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical\n    arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture\n    version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,\n    condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,\n    transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a\n    Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the\n    purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the\n    Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the\n    synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image\n    (\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose\n    of this License.\n\n    \"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work\n    under the terms of this License.\n\n    \"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the\n    Work.\n\n    \"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under\n    the terms of this License.\n\n    \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this\n    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License\n    with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission\n    from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a\n    previous violation.\n\n    \"License Elements\" means the following high-level license\n    attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of\n    this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.\n\n2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,\nlimit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or\nother limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under\ncopyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\nLicensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\nperpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to\nexercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\n    to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\n    Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\n    Collective Works;\n\n    to create and reproduce Derivative Works;\n\n    to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform\n    publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio\n    transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective\n    Works;\n\n    to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform\n    publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio\n    transmission Derivative Works.\n\n    For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical\n    composition:\n\n        Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives\n        the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a\n        performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties\n        for the public performance or public digital performance\n        (e.g. webcast) of the Work.\n\n        Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the\n        exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a\n        music rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox\n        Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the\n        Work (\"cover version\") and distribute, subject to the\n        compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US\n        Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n\n    Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of\n    doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the\n    exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a\n    performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the\n    public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to\n    the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US\n    Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\nknown or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make\nsuch modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights\nin other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by\nLicensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly\nmade subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n    You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or\n    publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this\n    License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\n    Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the\n    Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or\n    publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms\n    on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or\n    the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may\n    not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that\n    refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may\n    not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n    digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that\n    control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with\n    the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work\n    as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require\n    the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject\n    to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work,\n    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,\n    remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or\n    the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative\n    Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n    practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such\n    Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.\n\n    You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or\n    publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms\n    of this License, a later version of this License with the same\n    License Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons\n    license that contains the same License Elements as this License\n    (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Japan). You must include a copy\n    of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other\n    license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or\n    phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly\n    display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may\n    not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter\n    or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise\n    of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all\n    notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of\n    warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly\n    perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with\n    any technological measures that control access or use of the Work\n    in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License\n    Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work as\n    incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the\n    Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made\n    subject to the terms of this License.\n\n    If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n    digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective\n    Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\n    give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means\n    You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if\n    applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the\n    Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the\n    Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be\n    associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the\n    copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the\n    case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the\n    Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., \"French translation of the Work\n    by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by\n    Original Author\"). Such credit may be implemented in any\n    reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a\n    Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will\n    appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in\n    a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship\n    credit.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS\nTHE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND\nCONCERNING THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\nINCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\nLATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF\nERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW\nTHE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY\nTO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY\nLEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR\nEXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,\nEVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this\n    License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative\n    Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however,\n    will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals\n    or entities remain in full compliance with those\n    licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any\n    termination of this License.\n\n    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted\n    here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in\n    the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right\n    to release the Work under different license terms or to stop\n    distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such\n    election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other\n    license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the\n    terms of this License), and this License will continue in full\n    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n    Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or\n    a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license\n    to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license\n    granted to You under this License.\n\n    Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a\n    Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the\n    original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license\n    granted to You under this License.\n\n    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability\n    of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further\n    action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be\n    reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision\n    valid and enforceable.\n\n    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\n    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in\n    writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or\n    consent.\n\n    This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\n    with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no\n    understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the\n    Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any\n    additional provisions that may appear in any communication from\n    You.

  "AppleCDLv1.0": " Common Documentation License\n\nVersion 1.0 - February 16, 2001\n\nCopyright Â© 2001 Apple Computer, Inc.\n\nPermission is granted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\nLicense, but changing or adding to it in any way is not permitted.\n\nPlease read this License carefully before downloading or using this\nmaterial. By downloading or using this material, you are agreeing to\nbe bound by the terms of this License. If you do not or cannot agree\nto the terms of this License, please do not download or use this\nmaterial.\n\n0. Preamble. The Common Documentation License (CDL) provides a very\nsimple and consistent license that allows relatively unrestricted use\nand redistribution of documents while still maintaining the author's\ncredit and intent. To preserve simplicity, the License does not\nspecify in detail how (e.g. font size) or where (e.g. title page,\netc.) the author should be credited. To preserve consistency, changes\nto the CDL are not allowed and all derivatives of CDL documents are\nrequired to remain under the CDL. Together, these constraints enable\nthird parties to easily and safely reuse CDL documents, making the CDL\nideal for authors who desire a wide distribution of their\nwork. However, this means the CDL does not allow authors to restrict\nprecisely how their work is used or represented, making it\ninappropriate for those desiring more finely-grained control.\n\n1. General; Definitions. This License applies to any documentation,\nmanual or other work that contains a notice placed by the Copyright\nHolder stating that it is subject to the terms of this Common\nDocumentation License version 1.0 (or subsequent version thereof)\n(\"License\"). As used in this License:\n\n1.1 \"Copyright Holder\" means the original author(s) of the Document or\nother owner(s) of the copyright in the Document.\n\n1.2 \"Document(s)\" means any documentation, manual or other work that\nhas been identified as being subject to the terms of this License.\n\n1.3 \"Derivative Work\" means a work which is based upon a pre-existing\nDocument, such as a revision, modification, translation, abridgment,\ncondensation, expansion, or any other form in which such pre-existing\nDocument may be recast, transformed, or adapted.\n\n1.4 \"You\" or \"Your\" means an individual or a legal entity exercising\nrights under this License.\n\n2. Basic License. Subject to all the terms and conditions of this\nLicense, You may use, copy, modify, publicly display, distribute and\npublish the Document and your Derivative Works thereof, in any medium\nphysical or electronic, commercially or non-commercially; provided\nthat:\n \n    (a) all copyright notices in the Document are preserved;\n \n    (b) a copy of this License, or an incorporation of it by reference\n        in proper form as indicated in Exhibit A below, is included in\n        a conspicuous location in all copies such that it would be\n        reasonably viewed by the recipient of the Document; and\n\n    (c) You add no other terms or conditions to those of this License.\n\n3. Derivative Works. All Derivative Works are subject to the terms of\nthis License. You may copy and distribute a Derivative Work of the\nDocument under the conditions of Section 2 above, provided that You\nrelease the Derivative Work under the exact, verbatim terms of this\nLicense (i.e., the Derivative Work is licensed as a \"Document\" under\nthe terms of this License). In addition, Derivative Works of Documents\nmust meet the following requirements:\n\n    (a) All copyright and license notices in the original Document\n        must be preserved.\n\n    (b) An appropriate copyright notice for your Derivative Work must\n        be added adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n\n    (c) A statement briefly summarizing how your Derivative Work is\n        different from the original Document must be included in the\n        same place as your copyright notice.\n\n    (d) If it is not reasonably evident to a recipient of your\n        Derivative Work that the Derivative Work is subject to the\n        terms of this License, a statement indicating such fact must\n        be included in the same place as your copyright notice.\n\n4. Compilation with Independent Works.

  "GPLv2orlater_with_exception": " GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 2, June 1991\n\n Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n",

THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\n\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.

Definitions\n\n   1. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n   2. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.\n   3. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n   4. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n   5. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n   6. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n   7. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n   8. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\n   9. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\n\n2.

Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\n   1. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n   2. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\n   3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n   4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n   5.\n\n      For the avoidance of doubt:\n         1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n         2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\n         3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n   1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\n   2. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n   3. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n   1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n   2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n   3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n   4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n   5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n   6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\n\n    Creative Commons Notice\n\n    Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\n    Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons.

Eclipse has designated the Eclipse\nPublic License (EPL) as the follow-on version of the CPL.\n\nTHE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON\nPUBLIC LICENSE (\"AGREEMENT\"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF\nTHE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n    documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n\n    i) changes to the Program, and\n\n    ii) additions to the Program;\n\n    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\n    and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n    'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\n    such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's\n    behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program\n    which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\n    conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,\n    and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor\nwhich are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution\nalone or when combined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\nAgreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this\nAgreement, including all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n    copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,\n    publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the\n    Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative\n    works, in source code and object code form.\n\n    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n    license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such\n    Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This\n    patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution\n    and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the\n    Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\n    combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent\n    license shall not apply to any other combinations which include\n    the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\n    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other\n    entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for\n    claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\n    intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to\n    exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each\n    Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other\n    intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n    third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\n    distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to\n    acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\n    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n    sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n    the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form\nunder its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;\n    and\n\n    b) its license agreement:\n\n    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n    warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n    warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n    implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n    for a particular purpose;\n\n    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all\n    liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement\n    are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;\n    and\n\n    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n    Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\n    reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for\n    software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\n    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the\n    Program.\n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\nwithin the Program.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\nContribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\nRecipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain\nresponsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the\nlike. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use\nof the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a\ncommercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not\ncreate potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a\nContributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,\nsuch Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend\nand indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\")\nagainst any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising\nfrom claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party\nagainst the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts\nor omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its\ndistribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The\nobligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\ninfringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)\npromptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,\nand b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with\nthe Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\nclaim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those\nperformance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\nContributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor\nmust pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\nPROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY\nWARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\nOR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely\nresponsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\ndistributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\nexercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to\nthe risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable\nlaws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and\nunavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\nANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\nINCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\nWITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\nLIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\nNEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR\nDISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED\nHEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with\nrespect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or\ncounterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that\nContributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as\nof the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient\ninstitutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\ncross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\nitself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or\nhardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\nrights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\nlitigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably\npracticable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and\nany licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall\ncontinue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\nmay only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\nreserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\nthis Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\nSteward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial\nAgreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the\nAgreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of\nthe Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The\nProgram (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to\nthe version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,\nafter a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may\nelect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under\nthe new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)\nabove, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual\nproperty of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,\nby implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\nexpressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and\nthe intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No\nparty to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement\nmore than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives\nits rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n",

  "LGPLv2.1orlater": " GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 2.1, February 1999\n\n Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n",

Contributor Grant. \n\n\tSubject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor \n\thereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license \n\n\t(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or \n\ttrademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce,  modify, \n\tdisplay, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created \n\tby such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified \n\tbasis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a \n\tLarger Work; and \n\n\t(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of  \n\tModifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in \n\tcombination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such \n\tcombination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or \n\totherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or \n\tportions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by \n\tthat Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such \n\tcombination). \n\n\t(c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective \n\ton the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered \n\tCode. \n\n\t(d)  notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is \n\tgranted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the \n\tContributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for \n\tinfringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor \n\tVersion or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that \n\tContributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor \n\tVersion) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by \n\tCovered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.\n\n3. Distribution Obligations. \n\n3.1. Application of License.\n\n\tThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are \n\tgoverned by the terms of this License, including without limitation \n\tSection 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be \n\tdistributed only under the terms of this License or a future version \n\tof this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a \n\tcopy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You \n\tdistribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code \n\tversion that alters or restricts the applicable version of this \n\tLicense or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include \n\tan additional document offering the additional rights described in \n\tSection 3.5. \n\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n\n\tAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be \n\tmade available in Source Code form under the terms of this License \n\teither on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted \n\tElectronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an \n\tExecutable version available; and if made available via Electronic \n\tDistribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) \n\tmonths after the date it initially became available, or at least six \n\t(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification \n\thas been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for \n\tensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the \n\tElectronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. \n\n3.3. Description of Modifications.\n\n\tYou must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a \n\tfile documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and \n\tthe date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that \n\tthe Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original \n\tCode provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the \n\tInitial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an \n\tExecutable version or related documentation in which You describe the \n\torigin or ownership of the Covered Code. \n\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.\n\n\t(a) Third Party Claims.\n\n\tIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's \n\tintellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights \n\tgranted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor \n\tmust include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \n\t\"LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in \n\tsufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If \n\tContributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made \n\tavailable as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly \n\tmodify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available \n\tthereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate \n\tmailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who \n\treceived the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. \n\n\t(b) Contributor APIs.\n\n\tIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming \n\tinterface (\"API\") and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses \n\twhich are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must \n\talso include this information in the LEGAL file. \n\n\t(c) Representations.\n\n\tContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section \n\t3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications \n\tare Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has \n\tsufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n3.5. Required Notices.\n\n\tYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source \n\tCode. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source \n\tCode file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a \n\tlocation (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely \n\tto look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) \n\tYou may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in \n\tExhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation \n\tfor the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership \n\trights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to \n\tcharge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability \n\tobligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You \n\tmay do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial \n\tDeveloper or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than \n\tany such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is \n\toffered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial \n\tDeveloper and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the \n\tInitial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, \n\tsupport, indemnity or liability terms You offer. \n\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n\tYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the \n\trequirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, \n\tand if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of \n\tthe Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, \n\tincluding a description of how and where You have fulfilled the \n\tobligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included \n\tin any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or \n\tcollateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the \n\tCovered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered \n\tCode or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may \n\tcontain terms different from this License, provided that You are in \n\tcompliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the \n\tExecutable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's \n\trights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this \n\tLicense. If You distribute the Executable version under a different \n\tlicense You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ \n\tfrom this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial \n\tDeveloper or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the \n\tInitial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by \n\tthe Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such \n\tterms You offer. \n\n3.7. Larger Works.\n\n\tYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code \n\tnot governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger \n\tWork as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the \n\trequirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. \n\n\tIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this \n\tLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to \n\tstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with \n\tthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) \n\tdescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description \n\tmust be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must \n\tbe included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the \n\textent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be \n\tsufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to \n\tunderstand it.\n\n5. Application of this License. \n\n\tThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has \n\tattached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License. \n\n6.1. New Versions.\n\n\tSun Microsystems, Inc. (\"Sun\") may publish revised and/or new versions \n\tof the License from time to time. Each version will be given a \n\tdistinguishing version number. \n\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n\tOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the \n\tLicense, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that \n\tversion. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms \n\tof any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one \n\tother than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered \n\tCode created under this License. \n\n6.3. Derivative Works.\n\n\tIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may \n\tonly do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code \n\tgoverned by this License), You must: (a) rename Your license so that \n\tthe phrases \"Sun,\" \"Sun Public License,\" or \"SPL\" or any confusingly \n\tsimilar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your \n\tlicense differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear \n\tthat Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the \n\tSun Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, \n\tOriginal Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A \n\tshall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this \n\tLicense.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. \n\n\tCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS'' BASIS, \n\tWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, \n\tWITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF \n\tDEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. \n\tTHE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE \n\tIS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, \n\tYOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE \n\tCOST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER \n\tOF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF \n\tANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION. \n\n\t8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate \n\tautomatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure \n\tsuch breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All \n\tsublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall \n\tsurvive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their \n\tnature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License \n\tshall survive. \n\n\t8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement \n\tclaim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer \n\tor a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom \n\tYou file such action is referred to as \"Participant\")  alleging that: \n\n\t(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly \n\tinfringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such \n\tParticipant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License \n\tshall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, \n\tunless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)  \n\tagree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable \n\troyalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such \n\tParticipant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to \n\tthe Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days \n\tof notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not \n\tmutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim \n\tis not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under \n\tSections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of \n\tthe 60 day notice period specified above. \n\n\t(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's \n\tContributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then \n\tany rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) \n\tand 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, \n\tsold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that \n\tParticipant. \n\n\t8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant \n\talleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or \n\tindirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as \n\tby license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent \n\tinfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses \n\tgranted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken \n\tinto account in determining the amount or value of any payment or \n\tlicense. \n\n\t8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all \n\tend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) \n\twhich have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder \n\tprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. \n\n\tUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT \n\t(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL \n\tDEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, \n\tOR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR \n\tANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY \n\tCHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, \n\tWORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER \n\tCOMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN \n\tINFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF \n\tLIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY \n\tRESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW \n\tPROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE \n\tEXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO \n\tTHIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. \n\n\tThe Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48 \n\tC.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" \n\tand \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such terms are \n\tused in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. \n\t12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all \n\tU.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights \n\tset forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS. \n\n\tThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject \n\tmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be \n\tunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent \n\tnecessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by \n\tCalifornia law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if \n\tany, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. \n\tWith respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, \n\tor an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United \n\tStates of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be \n\tsubject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern \n\tDistrict of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, \n\tCalifornia, with the losing party responsible for costs, including \n\twithout limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and \n\texpenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on \n\tContracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. \n\tAny law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract \n\tshall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this \n\tLicense.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. \n\n\tAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is \n\tresponsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, \n\tout of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to \n\twork with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such \n\tresponsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or \n\tshall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. \n\n\tInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as \n\t?Multiple-Licensed?. ?Multiple-Licensed? means that the Initial \n\tDeveloper permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under \n\tYour choice of the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the \n\tInitial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\n\nExhibit A -Sun Public License Notice. \n\n\tThe contents of this file are subject to the Sun Public License \n\tVersion 1.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in \n\tcompliance with the License.

  "AladdinFPL": " Aladdin Free Public License\n(Version 9, September 18, 2000)\n\nCopyright (C) 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 Aladdin Enterprises,\nMenlo Park, California, U.S.A. All rights reserved.\n\n    NOTE: This License is not the same as any of the GNU Licenses\n    published by the Free Software Foundation. Its terms are\n    substantially different from those of the GNU Licenses. If you are\n    familiar with the GNU Licenses, please read this license with\n    extra care.\n\nAladdin Enterprises hereby grants to anyone the permission to apply\nthis License to their own work, as long as the entire License\n(including the above notices and this paragraph) is copied with no\nchanges, additions, or deletions except for changing the first\nparagraph of Section 0 to include a suitable description of the work\nto which the license is being applied and of the person or entity that\nholds the copyright in the work, and, if the License is being applied\nto a work created in a country other than the United States, replacing\nthe first paragraph of Section 6 with an appropriate reference to the\nlaws of the appropriate country.\n\nThis License is not an Open Source license: among other things, it\nplaces restrictions on distribution of the Program, specifically\nincluding sale of the Program. While Aladdin Enterprises respects and\nsupports the philosophy of the Open Source Definition, and shares the\ndesire of the GNU project to keep licensed software freely\nredistributable in both source and object form, we feel that Open\nSource licenses unfairly prevent developers of useful software from\nbeing compensated proportionately when others profit financially from\ntheir work. This License attempts to ensure that those who receive,\nredistribute, and contribute to the licensed Program according to the\nOpen Source and Free Software philosophies have the right to do so,\nwhile retaining for the developer(s) of the Program the power to make\nthose who use the Program to enhance the value of commercial products\npay for the privilege of doing so.  0. Subject Matter This License\napplies to the computer programs known as \"AFPL Ghostscript\", \"AFPL\nGhostscript PCL5e\", \"AFPL Ghostscript PCL5c\", and \"AFPL Ghostscript\nPXL\".  The \"Program\", below, refers to such program. The Program is a\ncopyrighted work whose copyright is held by Artifex Software Inc.,\nlocated in San Rafael California and artofcode LLC, located in\nBenicia, California (the \"Licensor\"). Please note that AFPL\nGhostscript is neither the program known as \"GNU Ghostscript\" nor the\nversion of Ghostscript available for commercial licensing from Artifex\nSoftware Inc.\n\nA \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\nderivative work of the Program, as defined in the United States\nCopyright Act of 1976, such as a translation or a modification.\n\nBY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE\nPROGRAM), YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND\nALL ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING\nTHE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE\nGRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS\nDERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT\nACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE\nPROGRAM.\n\n1. Licenses.\n\nLicensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you\ncomply with all of the restrictions set forth in this License and\nprovided, further, that you distribute an unmodified copy of this\nLicense with the Program:\n\n(a) You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the\n    Program's source code as you receive it throughout the world, in\n    any medium.\n\n(b) You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program and\n    distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any medium.\n\n2. Restrictions.\n\nThis license is subject to the following restrictions:\n\n(a) Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by a\n    commercial organization to any third party is prohibited if any\n    payment is made in connection with such distribution, whether\n    directly (as in payment for a copy of the Program) or indirectly\n    (as in payment for some service related to the Program, or payment\n    for some product or service that includes a copy of the Program\n    \"without charge\"; these are only examples, and not an exhaustive\n    enumeration of prohibited activities). The following methods of\n    distribution involving payment shall not in and of themselves be a\n    violation of this restriction:\n\n    (i) Posting the Program on a public access information storage and\n        retrieval service for which a fee is received for retrieving\n        information (such as an on-line service), provided that the\n        fee is not content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same\n        for retrieving the same volume of information consisting of\n        random data) and that access to the service and to the Program\n        is available independent of any other product or service. An\n        example of a service that does not fall under this section is\n        an on-line service that is operated by a company and that is\n        only available to customers of that company. (This is not an\n        exhaustive enumeration.)\n\n   (ii) Distributing the Program on removable computer-readable media,\n        provided that the files containing the Program are reproduced\n        entirely and verbatim on such media, that all information on\n        such media be redistributable for non-commercial purposes\n        without charge, and that such media are distributed by\n        themselves (except for accompanying documentation) independent\n        of any other product or service. Examples of such media\n        include CD-ROM, magnetic tape, and optical storage\n        media. (This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.) An\n        example of a distribution that does not fall under this\n        section is a CD-ROM included in a book or magazine. (This is\n        not an exhaustive enumeration.)\n\n(b) Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of\n    the Program are not subject to this License and they are outside\n    its scope. Functional use (running) of the Program is not\n    restricted, and any output produced through the use of the Program\n    is subject to this license only if its contents constitute a work\n    based on the Program (independent of having been made by running\n    the Program).\n\n(c) You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to any\n    work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part\n    contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof (\"the\n    Work\"):\n\n    (i) If you have modified the Program, you must cause the Work to\n        carry prominent notices stating that you have modified the\n        Program's files and the date of any change. In each source\n        file that you have modified, you must include a prominent\n        notice that you have modified the file, including your name,\n        your e-mail address (if any), and the date and purpose of the\n        change;\n\n   (ii) You must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at no\n        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License;\n\n  (iii) If the Work normally reads commands interactively when run,\n        you must cause it, at each time the Work commences operation,\n        to print or display an announcement including an appropriate\n        copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n        else, saying that you provide a warranty). Such notice must\n        also state that users may redistribute the Work only under the\n        conditions of this License and tell the user how to view the\n        copy of this License included with the Work. (Exceptions: if\n        the Program is interactive but normally prints or displays\n        such an announcement only at the request of a user, such as in\n        an \"About box\", the Work is required to print or display the\n        notice only under the same circumstances; if the Program\n        itself is interactive but does not normally print such an\n        announcement, the Work is not required to print an\n        announcement.);\n\n   (iv) You must accompany the Work with the complete corresponding\n        machine-readable source code, delivered on a medium\n        customarily used for software interchange. The source code for\n        a work means the preferred form of the work for making\n        modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source\n        code means all the source code for all modules it contains,\n        plus any associated interface definition files, plus the\n        scripts used to control compilation and installation of the\n        executable code. If you distribute with the Work any component\n        that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)\n        with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n        operating system on which the executable runs, you must also\n        distribute the source code of that component if you have it\n        and are allowed to do so;\n\n    (v) If you distribute any written or printed material at all with\n        the Work, such material must include either a written copy of\n        this License, or a prominent written indication that the Work\n        is covered by this License and written instructions for\n        printing and/or displaying the copy of the License on the\n        distribution medium;\n\n   (vi) You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient's\n        exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the\nequivalent ability to copy from a designated place, then offering\nequivalent ability to copy the source code from the same place counts\nas distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source code along with the object code.\n\n3. Reservation of Rights.\n\nNo rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth\nherein. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the\nProgram except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\nLicense. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from\nyou under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long\nas such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n4. Other Restrictions.\n\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical\ndistribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n5. Limitations.\n\nTHE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU \"AS IS,\" WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY\nRIGHTS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nPROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR\nLOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM\nTO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\nPARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n6. General.\n\nThis License is governed by the laws of the State of California,\nU.S.A., excluding choice of law rules.\n\nIf any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law,\nthat part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with\nthe law, and no other parts of the License shall be affected.\n\nFor United States Government users, the Program is provided with\nRESTRICTED RIGHTS. If you are a unit or agency of the United States\nGovernment or are acquiring the Program for any such unit or agency,\nthe following apply:\n\n    If the unit or agency is the Department of Defense (\"DOD\"), the\n    Program and its documentation are classified as \"commercial\n    computer software\" and \"commercial computer software\n    documentation\" respectively and, pursuant to DFAR Section\n    227.7202, the Government is acquiring the Program and its\n    documentation in accordance with the terms of this License. If the\n    unit or agency is other than DOD, the Program and its\n    documentation are classified as \"commercial computer software\" and\n    \"commercial computer software documentation\" respectively and,\n    pursuant to FAR Section 12.212, the Government is acquiring the\n    Program and its documentation in accordance with the terms of this\n    License.\n",

JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized compression\nmethod for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing\n\"real-world\" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images\nare not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not\nexactly identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use JPEG if you\nhave to have identical output bits.  However, on typical photographic images,\nvery good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and\nremarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a\nlow-quality image.  For more details, see the references, or just experiment\nwith various compression settings.\n\nThis software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive\ncompression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these\nprocesses, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.\nFor legal reasons, we are not distributing code for the arithmetic-coding\nvariants of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES.  We have made no provision for supporting\nthe hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.\n\nWe provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,\nplus two sample applications \"cjpeg\" and \"djpeg\", which use the library to\nperform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.\nThe library is intended to be reused in other applications.\n\nIn order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included\nconsiderable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;\nfor example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG\ndecoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or\ncolormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the\nlibrary if not required for a particular application.  We have also included\n\"jpegtran\", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG\nprocesses, and \"rdjpgcom\" and \"wrjpgcom\", two simple applications for\ninserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.\n\nThe emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and\nflexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,\nthe software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the\nREFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to\nbe reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have\nachieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.\n\nWe welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.\nNo royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product\ndocumentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.\n\n\nLEGAL ISSUES\n============\n\nIn plain English:\n\n1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,\n   please let us know!)\n2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.\n3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a\n   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that\n   you've used the IJG code.\n\nIn legalese:\n\nThe authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,\nwith respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or\nfitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided \"AS IS\", and you,\nits user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.\n\nThis software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.\nAll Rights Reserved except as specified below.\n\nPermission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this\nsoftware (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these\nconditions:\n(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this\nREADME file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice\nunaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files\nmust be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.\n(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying\ndocumentation must state that \"this software is based in part on the work of\nthe Independent JPEG Group\".\n(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts\nfull responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept\nNO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.\n\nThese conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,\nnot just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to\nacknowledge us.\n\nPermission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name\nin advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from\nit.  This software may be referred to only as \"the Independent JPEG Group's\nsoftware\".\n\nWe specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of\ncommercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are\nassumed by the product vendor.\n\n\nansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,\nsole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.\nansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead\nby the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,\nthat you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file\nansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part\nof any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than\nthe foregoing paragraphs do.\n\nThe Unix configuration script \"configure\" was produced with GNU Autoconf.\nIt is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.\nThe same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,\nltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright\nby M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.\n\nIt appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by\npatents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot\nlegally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,\nsupport for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.\n(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented\nHuffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)\nSo far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining\ncode.\n\nThe IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.\nTo avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has\nbeen removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce\n\"uncompressed GIFs\".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the\nresulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard\nGIF decoders.\n\nWe are required to state that\n    \"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of\n    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of\n    CompuServe Incorporated.\"\n\n\nREFERENCES\n==========\n\nWe highly recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to\nunderstand the innards of the JPEG software.\n\nThe best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is\n\tWallace, Gregory K.  \"The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard\",\n\tCommunications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.\n(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,\napplications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue\nhandy, a PostScript file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is\navailable at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/wallace.ps.gz.  The file (actually\na preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)\nomits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections\nand some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,\nand it may not be used for commercial purposes.\n\nA somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in\n\"The Data Compression Book\" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by\nM&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides\ngood explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods\nincluding JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C\ncode but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG\nsample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look\nat a full implementation, you've got one here...\n\nThe best full description of JPEG is the textbook \"JPEG Still Image Data\nCompression Standard\" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published\nby Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.  Price US$59.95, 638 pp.\nThe book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1\nand draft DIS 10918-2).  This is by far the most complete exposition of JPEG\nin existence, and we highly recommend it.\n\nThe JPEG standard itself is not available electronically; you must order a\npaper copy through ISO or ITU.  (Unless you feel a need to own a certified\nofficial copy, we recommend buying the Pennebaker and Mitchell book instead;\nit's much cheaper and includes a great deal of useful explanatory material.)\nIn the USA, copies of the standard may be ordered from ANSI Sales at (212)\n642-4900, or from Global Engineering Documents at (800) 854-7179.  (ANSI\ndoesn't take credit card orders, but Global does.)  It's not cheap: as of\n1992, ANSI was charging $95 for Part 1 and $47 for Part 2, plus 7%\nshipping/handling.  The standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the\nactual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1\nis titled \"Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,\nPart 1: Requirements and guidelines\" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS\n10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled \"Digital Compression and Coding of\nContinuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing\" and has document\nnumbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.\n\nSome extensions to the original JPEG standard are defined in JPEG Part 3,\na newer ISO standard numbered ISO/IEC IS 10918-3 and ITU-T T.84.  IJG\ncurrently does not support any Part 3 extensions.\n\nThe JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file\nformat.  For the omitted details we follow the \"JFIF\" conventions, revision\n1.02.  A copy of the JFIF spec is available from:\n\tLiterature Department\n\tC-Cube Microsystems, Inc.\n\t1778 McCarthy Blvd.\n\tMilpitas, CA 95035\n\tphone (408) 944-6300,  fax (408) 944-6314\nA PostScript version of this document is available by FTP at\nftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text\nversion at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing\nthe figures.\n\nThe TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from\nftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme\nfound in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.\nIJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).\nInstead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2\n(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from ftp.sgi.com or\nfrom ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/.  It is expected that the next revision\nof the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.\nAlthough IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library\nuses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.  libtiff is available\nfrom ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/.\n\n\nARCHIVE LOCATIONS\n=================\n\nThe \"official\" archive site for this software is ftp.uu.net (Internet\naddress 192.48.96.9).  The most recent released version can always be found\nthere in directory graphics/jpeg.  This particular version will be archived\nas ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz.  If you don't have\ndirect Internet access, UUNET's archives are also available via UUCP; contact\nhelp@uunet.uu.net for information on retrieving files that way.\n\nNumerous Internet sites maintain copies of the UUNET files.  However, only\nftp.uu.net is guaranteed to have the latest official version.\n\nYou can also obtain this software in DOS-compatible \"zip\" archive format from\nthe SimTel archives (ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/graphics/), or\non CompuServe in the Graphics Support forum (GO CIS:GRAPHSUP), library 12\n\"JPEG Tools\".  Again, these versions may sometimes lag behind the ftp.uu.net\nrelease.\n\nThe JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a useful source of\ngeneral information about JPEG.  It is updated constantly and therefore is\nnot included in this distribution.  The FAQ is posted every two weeks to\nUsenet newsgroups comp.graphics.misc, news.answers, and other groups.\nIt is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/\nand other news.answers archive sites, including the official news.answers\narchive at rtfm.mit.edu: ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/.\nIf you don't have Web or FTP access, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\nwith body\n\tsend usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part1\n\tsend usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part2\n\n\nRELATED SOFTWARE\n================\n\nNumerous viewing and image manipulation programs now support JPEG.  (Quite a\nfew of them use this library to do so.)  The JPEG FAQ described above lists\nsome of the more popular free and shareware viewers, and tells where to\nobtain them on Internet.\n\nIf you are on a Unix machine, we highly recommend Jef Poskanzer's free\nPBMPLUS software, which provides many useful operations on PPM-format image\nfiles.  In particular, it can convert PPM images to and from a wide range of\nother formats, thus making cjpeg/djpeg considerably more useful.  The latest\nversion is distributed by the NetPBM group, and is available from numerous\nsites, notably ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM/.\nUnfortunately PBMPLUS/NETPBM is not nearly as portable as the IJG software is;\nyou are likely to have difficulty making it work on any non-Unix machine.\n\nA different free JPEG implementation, written by the PVRG group at Stanford,\nis available from ftp://havefun.stanford.edu/pub/jpeg/.  This program\nis designed for research and experimentation rather than production use;\nit is slower, harder to use, and less portable than the IJG code, but it\nis easier to read and modify.  Also, the PVRG code supports lossless JPEG,\nwhich we do not.  (On the other hand, it doesn't do progressive JPEG.)\n\n\nFILE FORMAT WARS\n================\n\nSome JPEG programs produce files that are not compatible with our library.\nThe root of the problem is that the ISO JPEG committee failed to specify a\nconcrete file format.  Some vendors \"filled in the blanks\" on their own,\ncreating proprietary formats that no one else could read.  (For example, none\nof the early commercial JPEG implementations for the Macintosh were able to\nexchange compressed files.)\n\nThe file format we have adopted is called JFIF (see REFERENCES).  This format\nhas been agreed to by a number of major commercial JPEG vendors, and it has\nbecome the de facto standard.  JFIF is a minimal or \"low end\" representation.\nWe recommend the use of TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 as modified by TIFF\nTechnical Note #2) for \"high end\" applications that need to record a lot of\nadditional data about an image.  TIFF/JPEG is fairly new and not yet widely\nsupported, unfortunately.\n\nThe upcoming JPEG Part 3 standard defines a file format called SPIFF.\nSPIFF is interoperable with JFIF, in the sense that most JFIF decoders should\nbe able to read the most common variant of SPIFF.  SPIFF has some technical\nadvantages over JFIF, but its major claim to fame is simply that it is an\nofficial standard rather than an informal one.  At this point it is unclear\nwhether SPIFF will supersede JFIF or whether JFIF will remain the de-facto\nstandard.  IJG intends to support SPIFF once the standard is frozen, but we\nhave not decided whether it should become our default output format or not.\n(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading JFIF indefinitely.)\n\nVarious proprietary file formats incorporating JPEG compression also exist.\nWe have little or no sympathy for the existence of these formats.  Indeed,\none of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help\nforce convergence on common, open format standards for JPEG files.  Don't\nuse a proprietary file format!\n\n\nTO DO\n=====\n\nThe major thrust for v7 will probably be improvement of visual quality.\nThe current method for scaling the quantization tables is known not to be\nvery good at low Q values.  We also intend to investigate block boundary\nsmoothing, \"poor man's variable quantization\", and other means of improving\nquality-vs-file-size performance without sacrificing compatibility.\n\nIn future versions, we are considering supporting some of the upcoming JPEG\nPart 3 extensions --- principally, variable quantization and the SPIFF file\nformat.\n\nAs always, speeding things up is of great interest.\n\nPlease send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\n",

When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may\n    not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that\n    restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to\n    exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of\n    the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated\n    in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart\n    from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\n    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor\n    You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection\n    any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\n\n    If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections,\n    You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a),\n    keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,\n    reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name\n    of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,\n    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another\n    party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity,\n    journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's\n    copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means,\n    the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if\n    supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if\n    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,\n    unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or\n    licensing information for the Work. The credit required by this\n    Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;\n    provided, however, that in the case of a Collection, at a minimum\n    such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors\n    of the Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a\n    manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other\n    contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use\n    the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\n    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under\n    this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply\n    any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original\n    Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of\n    You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior\n    written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or\n    Attribution Parties.\n\n    Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\n    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as\n    part of any Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or\n    take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would\n    be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,\nLICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR\nWARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,\nSTATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF\nTITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,\nNONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,\nOR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\nDISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY\nLEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR\nEXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,\nEVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this\n    License. Individuals or entities who have received Collections\n    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\n    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\n    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\n    survive any termination of this License.\n\n    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted\n    here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in\n    the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right\n    to release the Work under different license terms or to stop\n    distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such\n    election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other\n    license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the\n    terms of this License), and this License will continue in full\n    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a\n    Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the\n    Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to\n    You under this License.\n\n    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability\n    of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further\n    action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be\n    reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision\n    valid and enforceable.\n\n    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\n    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in\n    writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or\n    consent.\n\n    This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\n    with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no\n    understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the\n    Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any\n    additional provisions that may appear in any communication from\n    You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written\n    agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n    The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in\n    this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne\n    Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as\n    amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the\n    WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and\n    Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention\n    (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter\n    take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License\n    terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding\n    provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the\n    applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted\n    under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not\n    granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to\n    be included in the License; this License is not intended to\n    restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\n\n    Creative Commons Notice\n\n    Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no\n    warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons\n    will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any\n    damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general,\n    special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection\n    to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences,\n    if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the\n    Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of\n    Licensor.\n\n    Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that\n    the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not\n    authorize the use by either party of the trademark \"Creative\n    Commons\" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons\n    without the prior written consent of Creative Commons.

  "OSLv3.0": " Open Software License v. 3.0 (OSL-3.0)\n\nThis Open Software License (the \"License\") applies to any original\nwork of authorship (the \"Original Work\") whose owner (the \"Licensor\")\nhas placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright\nnotice for the Original Work:\n\nLicensed under the Open Software License version 3.0\n\n1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide,\n   royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the\n   duration of the copyright, to do the following:\n\n a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part\n    of a collective work;\n\n b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the\n    Original Work, thereby creating derivative works (\"Derivative\n    Works\") based upon the Original Work;\n\n c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and\n    Derivative Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of\n    Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute or\n    communicate shall be licensed under this Open Software License;\n\n d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and\n\n e) to display the Original Work publicly.\n\n2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide,\n   royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent\n   claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the\n   Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the\n   patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import\n   the Original Work and Derivative Works.\n\n3) Grant of Source Code License. The term \"Source Code\" means the\n   preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it\n   and all available documentation describing how to modify the\n   Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy\n   of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the\n   Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the\n   right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy\n   of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably\n   calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for\n   as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.\n\n4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor\n   the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of\n   their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or\n   promote products derived from this Original Work without express\n   prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated\n   herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor's\n   trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other\n   intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use,\n   sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any\n   patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section\n   2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such\n   marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License\n   shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under\n   terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor\n   otherwise would have a right to license.\n\n5) External Deployment. The term \"External Deployment\" means the use,\n   distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative\n   Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works\n   may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are\n   distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as\n   an application intended for use over a network. As an express\n   condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any\n   External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative\n   Work as a distribution under section 1(c).\n\n6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any\n   Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or\n   trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as\n   well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text\n   identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause the\n   Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a\n   prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform\n   recipients that You have modified the Original Work.\n\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor\n   warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the\n   patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor\n   or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the\n   permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent\n   rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately preceding\n   sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an\n   \"AS IS\" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied,\n   including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement,\n   merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE\n   RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This\n   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this\n   License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License\n   except under this disclaimer.\n\n8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal\n   theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or\n   otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect,\n   special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character\n   arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work\n   including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work\n   stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other\n   commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall\n   not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\n\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented\n   to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable\n   acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If\n   You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a\n   Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the\n   circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the\n   terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to\n   undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right\n   to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing\n   so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by\n   copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is\n   intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including\n   \"fair use\" or \"fair dealing\"). This License shall terminate\n   immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights\n   granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the\n   conditions in Section 1(c).\n\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate\n    automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights\n    granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an\n    action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor\n    or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a\n    patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action\n    alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work\n    with other software or hardware.\n\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating\n    to this License may be brought only in the courts of a\n    jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor\n    conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that\n    jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The\n    application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\n    International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the\n    Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its\n    termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of\n    copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This\n    section shall survive the termination of this License.\n\n12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this\n    License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party\n    shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including,\n    without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred\n    in connection with such action, including any appeal of such\n    action. This section shall survive the termination of this\n    License.\n\n13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be\n    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n    necessary to make it enforceable.\n\n14) Definition of \"You\" in This License. \"You\" throughout this\n    License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a\n    legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of\n    the terms of, this License. For legal entities, \"You\" includes any\n    entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control\n    with you. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (i) the\n    power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of\n    such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership\n    of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)\n    beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\n15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not\n    otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and\n    Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such\n    uses by You.\n\n16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright Â© 2005\n    Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or\n    communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this\n    License permits You to modify this License as applied to the\n    Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the\n    text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your\n    modified version (the \"Modified License\") and apply it to other\n    original works of authorship subject to the following conditions:\n    (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License is\n    the \"Open Software License\" or \"OSL\" and you may not use those\n    names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace\n    the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice\n    \"Licensed under <insert your license name here>\" or with a notice\n    of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this\n    License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are\n    open source software unless your Modified License has been\n    approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its\n    license review and certification process.\n\nA brief explanation of this license is available.\nhttp://rosenlaw.com/OSL3.0-explained.htm\n\n(in case the link is unavailable:\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20110511180751/http://www.rosenlaw.com/OSL3.0-explained.pdf)\n",

  "AGPLv3orlater": " GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 19 November 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure\ncooperation with the community in the case of network server software.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\nspecific requirements.\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n",
  "Free-Art-L-v1.3": " Free Art License 1.3\n\n\n[ Copyleft Attitude ]\n\nFree Art License 1.3 (FAL 1.3)\n\nPreamble\n\nThe Free Art License grants the right to freely copy, distribute, and\ntransform creative works without infringing the author's rights.\n\nThe Free Art License recognizes and protects these rights. Their\nimplementation has been reformulated in order to allow everyone to use\ncreations of the human mind in a creative manner, regardless of their\ntypes and ways of expression.\n\nWhile the public's access to creations of the human mind usually is\nrestricted by the implementation of copyright law, it is favoured by\nthe Free Art License. This license intends to allow the use of a\nworkâ€™s resources; to establish new conditions for creating in order to\nincrease creation opportunities. The Free Art License grants the right\nto use a work, and acknowledges the right holderâ€™s and the userâ€™s\nrights and responsibility.\n\nThe invention and development of digital technologies, Internet and\nFree Software have changed creation methods: creations of the human\nmind can obviously be distributed, exchanged, and transformed. They\nallow to produce common works to which everyone can contribute to the\nbenefit of all.\n\nThe main rationale for this Free Art License is to promote and protect\nthese creations of the human mind according to the principles of\ncopyleft: freedom to use, copy, distribute, transform, and prohibition\nof exclusive appropriation.\n\nDefinitions\n\nâ€œworkâ€� either means the initial work, the subsequent works or the\ncommon work as defined hereafter:\n\nâ€œcommon workâ€� means a work composed of the initial work and all\nsubsequent contributions to it (originals and copies). The initial\nauthor is the one who, by choosing this license, defines the\nconditions under which contributions are made.\n\nâ€œInitial workâ€� means the work created by the initiator of the common\nwork (as defined above), the copies of which can be modified by\nwhoever wants to\n\nâ€œSubsequent worksâ€� means the contributions made by authors who\nparticipate in the evolution of the common work by exercising the\nrights to reproduce, distribute, and modify that are granted by the\nlicense.\n\nâ€œOriginalsâ€� (sources or resources of the work) means all copies of\neither the initial work or any subsequent work mentioning a date and\nused by their author(s) as references for any subsequent updates,\ninterpretations, copies or reproductions.\n\nâ€œCopyâ€� means any reproduction of an original as defined by this\nlicense.\n\n1. OBJECT\n\nThe aim of this license is to define the conditions under which one\ncan use this work freely.\n\n2. SCOPE\n\nThis work is subject to copyright law. Through this license its author\nspecifies the extent to which you can copy, distribute, and modify it.\n\n2.1 FREEDOM TO COPY (OR TO MAKE REPRODUCTIONS)\n\nYou have the right to copy this work for yourself, your friends or any\nother person, whatever the technique used.\n\n2.2 FREEDOM TO DISTRIBUTE, TO PERFORM IN PUBLIC\n\nYou have the right to distribute copies of this work; whether modified\nor not, whatever the medium and the place, with or without any charge,\nprovided that you: attach this license without any modification to the\ncopies of this work or indicate precisely where the license can be\nfound, specify to the recipient the names of the author(s) of the\noriginals, including yours if you have modified the work, specify to\nthe recipient where to access the originals (either initial or\nsubsequent).\n\nThe authors of the originals may, if they wish to, give you the right\nto distribute the originals under the same conditions as the copies.\n\n2.3 FREEDOM TO MODIFY\n\nYou have the right to modify copies of the originals (whether initial\nor subsequent) provided you comply with the following conditions: all\nconditions in article 2.2 above, if you distribute modified copies;\nindicate that the work has been modified and, if it is possible, what\nkind of modifications have been made; distribute the subsequent work\nunder the same license or any compatible license.\n\nThe author(s) of the original work may give you the right to modify it\nunder the same conditions as the copies.\n\n3. RELATED RIGHTS\n\nActivities giving rise to authorâ€™s rights and related rights shall not\nchallenge the rights granted by this license.\n\nFor example, this is the reason why performances must be subject to\nthe same license or a compatible license. Similarly, integrating the\nwork in a database, a compilation or an anthology shall not prevent\nanyone from using the work under the same conditions as those defined\nin this license.\n\n4. INCORPORATION OF THE WORK\n\nIncorporating this work into a larger work that is not subject to the\nFree Art License shall not challenge the rights granted by this\nlicense.\n\nIf the work can no longer be accessed apart from the larger work in\nwhich it is incorporated, then incorporation shall only be allowed\nunder the condition that the larger work is subject either to the Free\nArt License or a compatible license.\n\n5. COMPATIBILITY\n\nA license is compatible with the Free Art License provided: it gives\nthe right to copy, distribute, and modify copies of the work including\nfor commercial purposes and without any other restrictions than those\nrequired by the respect of the other compatibility criteria; it\nensures proper attribution of the work to its authors and access to\nprevious versions of the work when possible; it recognizes the Free\nArt License as compatible (reciprocity); it requires that changes made\nto the work be subject to the same license or to a license which also\nmeets these compatibility criteria.\n\n6. YOUR INTELLECTUAL RIGHTS\n\nThis license does not aim at denying your author's rights in your\ncontribution or any related right. By choosing to contribute to the\ndevelopment of this common work, you only agree to grant others the\nsame rights with regard to your contribution as those you were granted\nby this license. Conferring these rights does not mean you have to\ngive up your intellectual rights.\n\n7. YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nThe freedom to use the work as defined by the Free Art License (right\nto copy, distribute, modify) implies that everyone is responsible for\ntheir own actions.\n\n8. DURATION OF THE LICENSE\n\nThis license takes effect as of your acceptance of its terms. The act\nof copying, distributing, or modifying the work constitutes a tacit\nagreement. This license will remain in effect for as long as the\ncopyright which is attached to the work. If you do not respect the\nterms of this license, you automatically lose the rights that it\nconfers.\n\nIf the legal status or legislation to which you are subject makes it\nimpossible for you to respect the terms of this license, you may not\nmake use of the rights which it confers.\n\n9. VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE\n\nThis license may undergo periodic modifications to incorporate\nimprovements by its authors (instigators of the â€œCopyleft Attitudeâ€�\nmovement) by way of new, numbered versions.\n\nYou will always have the choice of accepting the terms contained in\nthe version under which the copy of the work was distributed to you,\nor alternatively, to use the provisions of one of the subsequent\nversions.\n\n10. SUB-LICENSING\n\nSub-licenses are not authorized by this license. Any person wishing to\nmake use of the rights that it confers will be directly bound to the\nauthors of the common work.\n\n11. LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\nThis license is written with respect to both French law and the Berne\nConvention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.\n\nUSER GUIDE\n\n- How to use the Free Art License?\n\nTo benefit from the Free Art License, you only need to mention the\nfollowing elements on your work:\n\n  [Name of the author, title, date of the work.

It is simply a\nconvenient reference for understanding the full Oculus VR Rift SDK\nLicense Agreement. The Summary is written as a user-friendly interface\nto the full Oculus VR Rift SDK License below. This Summary itself has no\nlegal value, and its contents do not appear in the actual license.\n\nFull-length Legal Copy:\n-----------------------\n\n1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement (the\n\"License\"), Oculus VR, Inc. (\"Oculus VR\") hereby grants to you a\nperpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,\nsublicenseable copyright license to use, reproduce, redistribute\n(subject to restrictions below), modify, and improve the software\ncontained in this Oculus VR Rift Software Development Kit (\"RIFT SDK\"),\nincluding, but not limited to, the samples, headers, LibOVR headers, and\nLibOVR source. This license is subject to the following terms and\nconditions:\n\n1.1. This license includes the non-exclusive license and right to use\n(i) the RIFT SDK to make applications, content, games and demos\n(collectively and generally referred to as â€œDeveloper Contentâ€�) that run\non the Oculus VR approved mobile hardware and software products (â€œOculus\nApproved Rift Productsâ€�) and which may incorporate the RIFT SDK in whole\nor in part in binary or object code; and (ii) to use the RIFT SDK to\ncreate derivative works of the RIFT SDK itself (\"RIFT SDK Derivatives\"),\nwhether in source, binary, or object form, in whole or in part,\nincluding third party software unless otherwise noted.\n\n1.2.

By way of example a mobile application or\ngame or demo that is developed using the RIFT SDK would not be a RIFT\nSDK Derivative , nor would a utility or tool set in a pre-existing game\nengine that is adapted to work with the RIFT SDK be a RIFT SDK\nDerivative. By way of example, but not limitation, a RIFT SDK Derivative\nis or would be: either (i) an adaptation of a utility or piece of code\nfrom the RIFT SDK to improve efficiency; or (ii) an addition of code or\nimprovement to the RIFT SDK that adds functionality.\n\n1.3 For the sake of clarification when you use the RIFT SDK (including\nRIFT SDK Derivatives) in or with Developer Content, you retain all\nrights to your Developer Content, and you have no obligations to share\nor license Developer Content (including your source and object code) to\nOculus VR or any third parties; provided, however, Oculus VR retains all\nrights to the RIFT SDK and the RIFT SDK Derivatives that may be\nincorporated into your Developer Content.\n\n1.4 You agree to and you will use the Flash Screen Warning and the\nHealth and Safety Warnings (collectively the â€œOculus Warningsâ€�) and the\nOculus VR health and safety protocols found in the Oculus Best Practices\nGuide (â€œOculus H&S Protocolsâ€�), and your use of the Oculus Warnings and\nthe Oculus end user license agreement (â€œOculus EULAâ€�) with your\nDeveloper Content as provided for in the Oculus Developer Center, all of\nwhich can be found at the following link:\nhttps://developer.oculusvr.com/?action=doc.\n\n2.

  "IBMPLv1.0": " IBM Public License Version 1.0\n\nTHE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM\nPUBLIC LICENSE (\"AGREEMENT\"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF\nTHE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n 1. DEFINITIONS\n\n    \"Contribution\" means:\n    \n     a.  in the case of International Business Machines Corporation\n         (\"IBM\"), the Original Program, and\n\n     b.  in the case of each Contributor,\n\n         i. changes to the Program, and\n           \n         ii. additions to the Program;\n\n            where such changes and/or additions to the Program\n            originate from and are distributed by that particular\n            Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a\n            Contributor if it was added to the Program by such\n            Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's\n            behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the\n            Program which: (i) are separate modules of software\n            distributed in conjunction with the Program under their\n            own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works\n            of the Program.\n\n    \"Contributor\" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.\n\n    \"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor\n    which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its\n    Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\n\n    \"Original Program\" means the original version of the software\n    accompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source\n    code, object code and documentation, if any.\n\n    \"Program\" means the Original Program and Contributions.\n\n    \"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this\n    Agreement, including all Contributors.\n\n 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n     a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor\n        hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,\n        royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare\n        derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\n        distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n        Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code\n        and object code form.\n\n     b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor\n        hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,\n        royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make,\n        use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\n        Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\n        object code form. This patent license shall apply to the\n        combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the\n        time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\n        addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be\n        covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not\n        apply to any other combinations which include the\n        Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\n     c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants\n        the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no\n        assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program\n        does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property\n        rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any\n        liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity\n        based on infringement of intellectual property rights or\n        otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and\n        licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\n        responsibility to secure any other intellectual property\n        rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent\n        license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the\n        Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that\n        license before distributing the Program.\n\n     d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n        sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to\n        grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n 3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n    A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code\n    form under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n     a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n       \n     b. its license agreement:\n\n         i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n            warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n            warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement,\n            and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability\n            and fitness for a particular purpose;\n\n        ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all\n            liability for damages, including direct, indirect,\n            special, incidental and consequential damages, such as\n            lost profits;\n\n       iii. states that any provisions which differ from this\n            Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by\n            any other party; and\n\n        iv. states that source code for the Program is available from\n            such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it\n            in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n            used for software exchange.\n\n    When the Program is made available in source code form:\n       \n     a. it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\n     b. a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\n    Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous\n    location in the Program:\n\n        CopyrightÂ© {date here}, International Business Machines\n        Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.\n\n    In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the\n    originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that\n    reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator\n    of the Contribution.\n\n 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\n    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain\n    responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and\n    the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the\n    commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the\n    Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\n    which does not create potential liability for other\n    Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in\n    a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial\n    Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other\n    Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n    damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims,\n    lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against\n    the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or\n    omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its\n    distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The\n    obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\n    relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n    infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor\n    must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of\n    such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\n    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and\n    any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor\n    may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\n    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a\n    commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a\n    Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes\n    performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X,\n    those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial\n    Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\n    Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the\n    other Contributors related to those performance claims and\n    warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay\n    any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those\n    damages.  \n\n 5. NO WARRANTY\n\n    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\n    PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\n    ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n    ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\n    MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\n    Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\n    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes\n    all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this\n    Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of\n    program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss\n    of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption\n    of operations.\n\n 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\n    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT\n    NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,\n    INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\n    (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON\n    ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR\n    TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF\n    THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY\n    RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\n    SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n 7. GENERAL\n\n    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable\n    under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or\n    enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,\n    and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision\n    shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\n    provision valid and enforceable.\n\n    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor\n    with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a\n    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent\n    licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this\n    Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is\n    filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation\n    against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\n    lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations\n    of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such\n    Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\n    Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is\n    filed.\n\n    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\n    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of\n    this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable\n    period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all\n    Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient\n    agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\n    reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under\n    this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to\n    the Program shall continue and survive.\n\n    IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this\n    Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement\n    will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program\n    (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the\n    version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,\n    after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may\n    elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)\n    under the new version. No one other than IBM has the right to\n    modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a)\n    and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the\n    intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\n    whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All\n    rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement\n    are reserved.\n\n    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York\n    and the intellectual property laws of the United States of\n    America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action\n    under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action\n    arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any\n    resulting litigation.\n",
  "AGPLv1": " Note: The GNU Affero General Public License version 3 has been\n  released. It follows the same basic structure as this license, but\n  it is based on version 3 of the GNU GPL, and you can combine modules\n  released under GPLv3 and the GNU AGPLv3. If you were thinking about\n  releasing your software under this license, we recommend you use the\n  GNU AGPLv3 instead.\n\n  Additionally, in order to permit \"upgrading\" existing software\n  released under the Affero General Public License version 1 or later\n  as published by Affero, Inc. to GNU AGPLv3, Affero has published the\n  Affero General Public License version 2.\n\nAFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 1, March 2002\n\nCopyright Â© 2002 Affero Inc.\n510 Third Street - Suite 225, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA\n\nThis license is a modified version of the GNU General Public License\ncopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. made with\ntheir permission. Section 2(d) has been added to cover use of software\nover a computer network.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\nlicense document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\nto share and change it. By contrast, the Affero General Public License\nis intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This\nPublic License applies to most of Affero's software and to any other\nprogram whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Affero software\nis covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can\napply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. This General Public License is designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,\nwe want its recipients to know that what they have is not the\noriginal, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect\non the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at\nall.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this Affero General Public License. The \"Program\",\nbelow, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the\nProgram\" means either the Program or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\ninto another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\nlimitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as\n\"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\nis true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\nand disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\nthis License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\nrecipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the\nProgram.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\nit, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,\nprovided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n* a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n* b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n  whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\n  thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n  under the terms of this License.\n\n* c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n  when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n  interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n  announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n  that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n  warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n  conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n  License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n  not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the\n  Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\n* d) If the Program as you received it is intended to interact with\n  users through a computer network and if, in the version you\n  received, any user interacting with the Program was given the\n  opportunity to request transmission to that user of the Program's\n  complete source code, you must not remove that facility from your\n  modified version of the Program or work based on the Program, and\n  must offer an equivalent opportunity for all users interacting with\n  your Program through a computer network to request immediate\n  transmission by HTTP of the complete source code of your modified\n  version or other derivative work.\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n* a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n  and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;\n  or,\n\n* b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n  years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost\n  of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n  machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n  distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n  customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n* c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n  distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\n  only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\n  program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\n  accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\nto copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and\nwill automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,\nparties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\nherein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\nparties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices. Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. Affero Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the Affero\nGeneral Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be\nsimilar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nAffero, Inc. If the Program does not specify a version number of this\nLicense, you may choose any version ever published by Affero, Inc.\n\nYou may also choose to redistribute modified versions of this program\nunder any version of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public\nLicense version 3 or higher, so long as that version of the GNU GPL\nincludes terms and conditions substantially equivalent to those of\nthis license.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\nauthor to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by\nAffero, Inc., write to us; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE\nLAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\nAND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF\nANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nPROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nPROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n",
  "AGPLv3": " GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 19 November 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure\ncooperation with the community in the case of network server software.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\nspecific requirements.\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n",

  "GPLv3-for-fonts": " GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n",

  "Python1.6a2": " Python Copyright\n\nHistorical note: This page describes the Python license used for\nPython versions up to and including Python 1.6a2. CNRI released Python\n1.6b1 and the final Python 1.6 release under a different license,\nwhich is open source compliant, but not compatible with the GPL (the\nonly incompatibility being the inclusion of a choice-of-law\nclause). More recent PSF releases, in particular 2.0.1, 2.1.1, and all\nreleases since then, are GPL-compatible.  Most Python sources and\nbinaries are distributed under the following copyright. A few files\nhave a different copyright owner, but otherwise the notice is similar.\n\n\n  *\"final Python 1.6\" above links to:\n  http://web.archive.org/web/20070208215509/http://www.python.org/download/releases/1.6/\n\n  *\"PSF\" above links to:\n  http://web.archive.org/web/20070202204117/http://www.python.org/psf/\n  \n  *\"2.0.1, 2.1.1, and all releases since then\" links to:\n  http://web.archive.org/web/20070202023003/http://www.python.org/download/\n\n\nThe gist of it is that Python is absolutely free, even for commercial\nuse (including resale). There is no GNU-like \"copyleft\" restriction.\n\nA clarification: some very picky lawyers are worried that the notice\ndoesn't explicitly grant permission to distribute modified copies\n(even though it grants permission to copy, modify, and\ndistribute). This can be considered an oversight in the notice; we\nhave no intention to limit distribution of modified copies (that\notherwise play by the rules).

Additional Definitions.\n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n",

However, this Preamble is not a part of\nthis license. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon\nthe terms of the License and not this Preamble. This License complies\nwith the Open Source Definition and has been approved by Open Source\nInitiative. Software distributed under this License may be marked as\n\"OSI Certified Open Source Software.\"\n\nThis License provides that:\n\n   1. You may use, sell or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as\n   a component of an aggregate software distribution containing\n   programs from several different sources. No royalty or other fee is\n   required.\n\n   2. Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed\n   Product, including Modifications made by previous Contributors, are\n   available for your use. (The terms \"Licensed Product,\"\n   \"Modifications,\" \"Contributors\" and \"Source Code\" are defined in\n   the License.)\n\n   3. You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product,\n   and you can create Derivative Works from it. (The term \"Derivative\n   Works\" is defined in the License.)\n\n   4. By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this\n   License, you agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed\n   Product and then distribute are governed by the provisions of this\n   License. In particular, you must make the Source Code of your\n   Modifications available to others.\n\n   5. You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the\n   Licensor is not providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the\n   Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed\n   Product doesn't work properly or causes you any injury or damages.\n\n   6. If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you\n   may charge fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity\n   or liability obligations to your customers. You cannot charge for\n   the Source Code.\n\n   7. If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to\n   the Licensed Product, or if you breach any terms of the License,\n   your rights to the Licensed Product under this License\n   automatically terminate.\n\n   You may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works,\n   in which case the provisions of this License will apply to your\n   Derivative Works just as they do to the original Licensed Product.\n\n   Alternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any\n   other OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary\n   license of your choice. If you use any license other than this\n   License, however, you must continue to fulfill the requirements of\n   this License (including the provisions relating to publishing the\n   Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that\n   consist of the Licensed Product, including the files containing\n   Modifications.\n\n   New versions of this License may be published from time to\n   time. You may choose to continue to use the license terms in this\n   version of the License or those from the new version. However, only\n   the Licensor has the right to change the License terms as they\n   apply to the Licensed Product. This License relies on precise\n   definitions for certain terms. Those terms are defined when they\n   are first used, and the definitions are repeated for your\n   convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.\n\nLicense Terms\n\n   1. Grant of License From Licensor. Licensor hereby grants you a\n   world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third\n   party intellectual property claims, to do the following:\n\n     a. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and\n     distribute Licensed Product or portions thereof (including\n     Modifications as hereinafter defined), in both Source Code or as\n     an executable program. \"Source Code\" means the preferred form for\n     making modifications to the Licensed Product, including all\n     modules contained therein, plus any associated interface\n     definition files, scripts used to control compilation and\n     installation of an executable program, or a list of differential\n     comparisons against the Source Code of the Licensed Product.\n\n     b. Create Derivative Works (as that term is defined under\n     U.S. copyright law) of Licensed Product by adding to or deleting\n     from the substance or structure of said Licensed Product.\n\n     c. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled\n     by Licensor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,\n     and/or otherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions thereof,\n     but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to\n     enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or\n     otherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions thereof or\n     Derivative Works thereof.\n\n   2. Grant of License to Modifications From\n   Contributor. \"Modifications\" means any additions to or deletions\n   from the substance or structure of (i) a file containing Licensed\n   Product, or (ii) any new file that contains any part of Licensed\n   Product. Hereinafter in this License, the term \"Licensed Product\"\n   shall include all previous Modifications that you receive from any\n   Contributor. By application of the provisions in Section 4(a)\n   below, each person or entity who created or contributed to the\n   creation of, and distributed, a Modification (a \"Contributor\")\n   hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive\n   license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do\n   the following:\n\n     a. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and\n     distribute any Modifications created by such Contributor or\n     portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable\n     program, either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative\n     Works.\n\n     b. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled\n     by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,\n     and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof,\n     but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to\n     enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or\n     otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or\n     Derivative Works thereof.\n\n   3. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be\n   deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents,\n   trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any\n   Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is\n   granted separate from the Licensed Product, for code that you\n   delete from the Licensed Product, or for combinations of the\n   Licensed Product with other software or hardware. No right is\n   granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if\n   such marks are included in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this\n   License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing\n   under different terms from this License any code that Licensor\n   otherwise would have a right to license.\n\n   4. Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.\n      \n     a. Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an\n     express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you\n     hereby agree that any Modifications that you create or to which\n     you contribute, and which you distribute, are governed by the\n     terms of this License including, without limitation, Section\n     2. Any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute\n     may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a\n     future version of this License released under Section 7. You must\n     include a copy of this License with every copy of the\n     Modifications you distribute. You agree not to offer or impose\n     any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the\n     Licensed Product or Modifications that alter or restrict the\n     applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights\n     hereunder. However, you may include an additional document\n     offering the additional rights described in Section 4(e).\n\n     b. Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under\n     the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed\n     Product and any Modifications that you distribute, either on the\n     same media as you distribute any executable or other form of the\n     Licensed Product, or via a mechanism generally accepted in the\n     software development community for the electronic transfer of\n     data (an \"Electronic Distribution Mechanism\"). The Source Code\n     for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that you\n     distribute must remain available for at least twelve (12) months\n     after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)\n     months after a subsequent version of said Licensed Product or\n     Modifications has been made available. You are responsible for\n     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if\n     the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third\n     party.\n\n     c. Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications\n     that you create or to which you contribute, and which you\n     distribute, to contain a file documenting the additions, changes\n     or deletions you made to create or contribute to those\n     Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or\n     deletions. You must include a prominent statement that the\n     Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the\n     Licensed Product and include the names of the Licensor and any\n     Contributor to the Licensed Product in (i) the Source Code and\n     (ii) in any notice displayed by a version of the Licensed Product\n     you distribute or in related documentation in which you describe\n     the origin or ownership of the Licensed Product. You may not\n     modify or delete any preexisting copyright notices in the\n     Licensed Product.\n\n     d. Intellectual Property Matters.\n\n       i. Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to\n       a third party's intellectual property right is required to\n       exercise the rights granted by this License, you must include a\n       text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" that\n       describes the claim and the party making the claim in\n       sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to\n       contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any\n       Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall\n       promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available\n       thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying\n       appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated\n       to inform those who received the Licensed Product from you that\n       new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n       ii. Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an\n       application programming interface (\"API\") and you have\n       knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to\n       implement that API, you must also include this information in\n       the LEGAL file.\n\n       iii. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed\n       pursuant to 4(d)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications\n       you distribute are your original creations and that you have\n       sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n     e. Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any\n     documentation you provide along with the Source Code of any\n     Modifications you create or to which you contribute, and which\n     you distribute, wherever you describe recipients' rights relating\n     to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the notice contained in\n     Exhibit A (the \"Notice\") in each file of the Source Code of any\n     copy you distribute of the Licensed Product. If you created a\n     Modification, you may add your name as a Contributor to the\n     Notice. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular\n     Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such\n     Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a\n     user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to\n     offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or\n     liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed\n     Product. However, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not\n     on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it\n     clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n     obligation is offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to\n     indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability\n     incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of\n     warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer.\n\n     f. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute\n     Licensed Product as an executable program under a license of your\n     choice that may contain terms different from this License\n     provided (i) you have satisfied the requirements of Sections 4(a)\n     through 4(e) for that distribution, (ii) you include a\n     conspicuous notice in the executable version, related\n     documentation and collateral materials stating that the Source\n     Code version of the Licensed Product is available under the terms\n     of this License, including a description of how and where you\n     have fulfilled the obligations of Section 4(b), (iii) you retain\n     all existing copyright notices in the Licensed Product, and (iv)\n     you make it clear that any terms that differ from this License\n     are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or any Contributor. You\n     hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for\n     any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as a\n     result of any terms you offer.\n\n     g. Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create Derivative\n     Works (e.g., combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product\n     with other code) and distribute the Derivative Works as products\n     under any other license you select, with the proviso that the\n     requirements of this License are fulfilled for those portions of\n     the Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product or any\n     Modifications thereto.\n\n   5. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is\n   impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this License\n   with respect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to statute,\n   judicial order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the\n   terms of this License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the\n   statute or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the\n   License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the code they\n   affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file\n   described in Section 4(d), and must be included with all\n   distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited\n   by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently\n   detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill at computer programming\n   to be able to understand it.\n\n   6. Application of This License. This License applies to code to\n   which Licensor or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A,\n   which is incorporated herein by this reference.\n\n   7. Versions of This License.\n\n     a. New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised\n     and/or new versions of the License.\n\n     b. Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been\n     published under a particular version of the License, you may\n     always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You\n     may also choose to use such Licensed Product under the terms of\n     any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No\n     one other than Lic ensor has the right to modify the terms\n     applicable to Licensed Product created under this License.\n\n     c. Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a\n     modified version of this License, which you may do only in order\n     to apply it to software that is not already a Licensed Product\n     under this License, you must rename your license so that it is\n     not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear\n     that your license contains terms that differ from this\n     License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark\n     of Licensor or any Contributor.\n\n   8. Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS\n   LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER\n   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT\n   THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A\n   PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE\n   QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD\n   LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE\n   LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY\n   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY\n   CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED\n   PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n   9. Termination.\n\n     a. Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights\n     granted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to\n     comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within\n     thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses\n     to the Licensed Product that are properly granted shall survive\n     any termination of this license. Provisions that, by their\n     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this\n     License, shall survive.\n\n     b. Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you\n     initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim\n     (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a\n     Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom you file such\n     an action is referred to herein as \"Respondent\") alleging that\n     Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent,\n     then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to you under\n     Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively\n     upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the \"Notice Period\")\n     unless within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i)\n     to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for\n     your past or future use of Licensed Product made by such\n     Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with respect\n     to Licensed Product against such Respondent. If within said\n     Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are\n     not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the\n     litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor\n     to you under Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the\n     expiration of said Notice Period.\n\n     c. Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent\n     infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed\n     Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such\n     claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the\n     initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable\n     value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 1\n     and 2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or\n     value of any payment or license.\n\n     d. No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of\n     termination under Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user\n     license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and\n     reselle rs) that have been validly granted by you or any\n     distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive\n     termination.\n\n  10. Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO\n  LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR\n  OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR\n  OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE\n  LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\n  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER\n  FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR\n  LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE\n  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT\n  APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH\n  PARTYÃ•S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH\n  LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR\n  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION\n  AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  11. Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors,\n  each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly\n  or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this\n  License. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to\n  distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein\n  is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of\n  liability.\n\n  12. U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Product is a \"commercial\n  item,\" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995),\n  consisting of \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial\n  computer software documentation,\" as such terms are used in 48\n  C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48\n  C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all\n  U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Product with only those\n  rights set forth herein.\n\n  13. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement\n  concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this\n  License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be\n  reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This\n  License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to\n  the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding\n  its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that any\n  litigation relating to this license shall be subject to the\n  jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of\n  California or the Superior Court of the County of Santa Clara,\n  California (as appropriate), with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\n  California, with the losing party responsible for costs including,\n  without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and\n  expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n  Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly\n  excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury\n  trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Product or this\n  License. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a\n  contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to\n  this License.\n\n  14. Definition of \"You\" in This License. \"You\" throughout this\n  License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a\n  legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the\n  terms of, this License or a future version of this License issued\n  under Section 7. For legal entities, \"you\" includes any entity that\n  controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For\n  purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (i) the power, direct\n  or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,\n  whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent\n  (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial\n  ownership of such entity.\n\n  15. Glossary. All defined terms in this License that are used in\n  more than one Section of this License are repeated here, in\n  alphabetical order, for the convenience of the reader. The Section\n  of this License in which each defined term is first used is shown in\n  parentheses.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\nï¿½\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nï¿½\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\nï¿½\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\nï¿½\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nï¿½\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n",

No.168, Yung Chi Rd., Taipei, 110 Taiwan\nAll rights reserved except as specified below.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\nlicense document, but changing it is forbidden.\n\nPreamble\n\n   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n   freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the ARPHIC PUBLIC\n   LICENSE specifically permits and encourages you to use this\n   software, provided that you give the recipients all the rights that\n   we gave you and make sure they can get the modifications of this\n   software.\n\nLegal Terms\n\n0. Definitions:\n\n   Throughout this License, \"Font\" means the TrueType fonts \"AR PL\n   Mingti2L Big5\", \"AR PL KaitiM Big5\" (BIG-5 character set) and \"AR\n   PL SungtiL GB\", \"AR PL KaitiM GB\" (GB character set) which are\n   originally distributed by Arphic, and the derivatives of those\n   fonts created through any modification including modifying glyph,\n   reordering glyph, converting format, changing font name, or\n   adding/deleting some characters in/from glyph table.\n\n   \"PL\" means \"Public License\".\n\n   \"Copyright Holder\" means whoever is named in the copyright or\n   copyrights for the Font.\n\n   \"You\" means the licensee, or person copying, redistributing or\n   modifying the Font.\n\n   \"Freely Available\" means that you have the freedom to copy or\n   modify the Font as well as redistribute copies of the Font under\n   the same conditions you received, not price. If you wish, you can\n   charge for this service.\n\n1. Copying & Distribution\n\n   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of this Font in any\n   medium, without restriction, provided that you retain this license\n   file (ARPHICPL.TXT) unaltered in all copies.\n\n2. Modification\n\n   You may otherwise modify your copy of this Font in any way,\n   including modifying glyph, reordering glyph, converting format,\n   changing font name, or adding/deleting some characters in/from\n   glyph table, and copy and distribute such modifications under the\n   terms of Section 1 above, provided that the following conditions\n   are met:\n\n   a) You must insert a prominent notice in each modified file stating\n      how and when you changed that file.\n\n   b) You must make such modifications Freely Available as a whole to\n      all third parties under the terms of this License, such as by\n      offering access to copy the modifications from a designated\n      place, or distributing the modifications on a medium customarily\n      used for software interchange.\n\n   c) If the modified fonts normally reads commands interactively when\n      run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you\n      provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the Font\n      under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\n      of this License.\n\n   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\n   identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Font,\n   and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n   themselves, then this License and its terms, do not apply to those\n   sections when you distribute them as separate works. Therefore,\n   mere aggregation of another work not based on the Font with the\n   Font on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\n   the other work under the scope of this License.\n\n3. Condition Subsequent\n\n   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Font except\n   as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to\n   copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Font will automatically\n   retroactively void your rights under this License. However, parties\n   who have received copies or rights from you under this License will\n   keep their licenses valid so long as such parties remain in full\n   compliance.\n\n4. Acceptance\n\n   You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n   signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy,\n   modify, sublicense or distribute the Font. These actions are\n   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\n   copying, modifying, sublicensing or distributing the Font, you\n   indicate your acceptance of this License and all its terms and\n   conditions.\n\n5. Automatic Receipt\n\n   Each time you redistribute the Font, the recipient automatically\n   receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute\n   or modify the Font subject to these terms and conditions. You may\n   not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of\n   the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\n   compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n6. Contradiction\n\n   If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent\n   issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,\n   agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this\n   License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\n   License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously\n   your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n   obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Font\n   at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\n   royalty-free redistribution of the Font by all those who receive\n   copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\n   could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely\n   from distribution of the Font.\n\n   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable\n   under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is\n   intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply\n   in other circumstances.\n\n7. NO WARRANTY\n\n   BECAUSE THE FONT IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\n   FOR THE FONT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT\n   WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER\n   PARTIES PROVIDE THE FONT \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n   EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE\n   IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n   PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n   FONT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE FONT PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE\n   COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n8. DAMAGES WAIVER\n\n   UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, IN NO\n   EVENT WILL ANY COPYRIGHTT HOLDERS, OR OTHER PARTIES WHO MAY COPY,\n   MODIFY OR REDISTRIBUTE THE FONT AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO\n   YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR\n   EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n   FONT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS\n   OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS\n   INTERRUPTION), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN\n   ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n",

  "Vim1.4": " VIM LICENSE\n\nI)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except\n    that they must include this license text.  You can also distribute\n    unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must\n    include this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables\n    that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage\n    examples and Vim scripts.\n\nII) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,\n    including executables and/or source code, when the following four\n    conditions are met:\n    1) This license text must be included unmodified.\n    2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:\n       a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in\n          the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you\n          (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you\n          must make your changes, including source code, available to the\n          maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to\n          include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the\n          maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they\n          will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation\n          then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.\n        The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>. If this \n          changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely\n          vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When it is completely\n          impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him\n          your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has\n          received your changes they will not have to be sent again.\n       b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as\n          mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it\n          unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the\n          text under a) applies to those changes.\n       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of\n          the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of a\n          context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you\n          add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from\n          making their own changes to the official version of Vim.\n       d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned\n          under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the\n          changes if the following three conditions are met:\n          - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute\n            the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and\n            permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official\n            version of Vim without fee or restriction.\n          - You keep the changes for at least three years after last\n            distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer\n            or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in\n            any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them\n            available to him.\n          - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This\n            contact information must remain valid for at least three years\n            after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long\n            as possible.\n       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,\n          you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or\n          any later version.\n    3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the \":version\"\n       command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim\n       is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned\n       under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does\n       not conflict with the license used for the changes.\n    4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be\n       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make\n       corrections.\n\nIII) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use\n     the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the\n     maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is\n     by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.\n     If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a\n     context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is\n<maintainer@vim.org> \n\nIV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim\n     sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this\n     license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came\n     with, at your option.\n\n\nNote:\n\n- If you are happy with Vim, please express that by reading the rest of this\n  file and consider helping needy children in Uganda.\n\n- If you want to support further Vim development consider becoming a\n",

  "ODbl": " ## ODC Open Database License (ODbL)\n\n### Preamble\n\nThe Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to\nallow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while\nmaintaining this same freedom for others. Many databases are covered by\ncopyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some\njurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that\ncover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally,\nthe ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to\nact in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.\n\nDatabases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,\naudiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),\nand so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the\ncontents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL\ntogether with another license for the contents, if the contents have a\nsingle set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the\ncontents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should\ndescribe what rights govern what contents together in the individual\nrecord or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply. \n\nSometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be\ncovered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,\ntrade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights\nover information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may\nhave to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing\nactivities not covered by this License.\n\n------\n\nThe Licensor (as defined below) \n\nand \n\nYou (as defined below) \n\nagree as follows: \n\n### 1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words\n\n\"Collective Database\" â€“ Means this Database in unmodified form as part\nof a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are\nassembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective\nDatabase will not be considered a Derivative Database.\n\n\"Convey\" â€“ As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database,\nor the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables\na Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative\nDatabase.  Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a\ncomputer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no\ntransfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.\n\"Contents\" â€“ The contents of this Database, which includes the\ninformation, independent works, or other material collected into the\nDatabase. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual\ndata or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.\n\n\"Database\" â€“ A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a\nsystematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic\nor other means offered under the terms of this License.\n\n\"Database Directive\" â€“ Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection\nof databases, as amended or succeeded.\n\n\"Database Right\" â€“ Means rights resulting from the Chapter III (\"sui\ngeneris\") rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed\nby member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of\nthe whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar\nrights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4. \n\n\"Derivative Database\" â€“ Means a database based upon the Database, and\nincludes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any\nother alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the\nContents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or\nRe-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new\nDatabase.\n\n\"Extraction\" â€“ Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a\nSubstantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in\nany form.\n\n\"License\" â€“ Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights\nsuch as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract.\n\n\"Licensor\" â€“ Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms\nof this License. \n\n\"Person\" â€“ Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons\ncorporate or incorporate.\n\n\"Produced Work\" â€“  a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text,\nor sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the\nContents (via a search or other query) from this Database, a Derivative\nDatabase, or this Database as part of a Collective Database.  \n\n\"Publicly\" â€“ means to Persons other than You or under Your control by\neither more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their\nactivities (such as contracting with an independent consultant). \n\n\"Re-utilisation\" â€“ means any form of making available to the public all\nor a Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by\nrenting, by online or other forms of transmission.\n\n\"Substantial\" â€“ Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a\ncombination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or\nRe-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the\nExtraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.\n\n\"Use\" â€“ As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright\nor Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and\nincludes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing,\npublicly displaying, and preparing derivative works of the Database, as\nwell as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it\nin a different mode or format. \n\n\"You\" â€“ Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not\npreviously violated the terms of this License with respect to the\nDatabase, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to\nexercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\nWords in the singular include the plural and vice versa.\n\n### 2.0 What this License covers\n\n2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:\n\n  a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;\n\n  b. A license of the Database Right; and\n\n  c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.\n\n2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the\nDatabase, including:\n\n  a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.\n  The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the\n  Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents\n  independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright\n  law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database\n  model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation\n  of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table\n  indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of\n  Contents stored in the Database;\n\n  b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and\n  Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.\n  Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the\n  Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed\n  from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would\n  not infringe any applicable copyright; and\n\n  c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for\n  access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of\n  use on this access as outlined in this License. \n\n2.3 Rights not covered. \n\n  a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making\n  or operation of the Database; \n\n  b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the\n  Database; and\n\n  c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the\n  Database. \n\n2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of\nthe Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,\nincluding copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality\nrights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database\nRights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.\nFor example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this\nLicense would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could\nhave their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of\nthe rights over the images.  \n\n### 3.0 Rights granted\n\n3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor\ngrants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but\nonly under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of\nany applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly\ninclude commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To\nthe extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be\nexercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the\nfuture. \n\nThe rights granted cover, for example:\n\n  a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of\n  the Contents;\n\n  b. Creation of Derivative Databases;\n\n  c. Creation of Collective Databases;\n\n  d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and\n  in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative\n  Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and\n\n  e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or\n  performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in\n  part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective\n  Databases.\n\n3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n  a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n  compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves\n  the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\n  of the rights granted under this License;\n\n  b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n  compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the\n  exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of\n  the rights granted under this License; and,\n\n  c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect\n  royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is\n  a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing\n  schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights\n  granted under this License.\n\n3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop\ndistributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that\nthis Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice\nof using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section\n10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.\n\n### 4.0 Conditions of Use\n\n4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to\nYour complying with the following conditions of use. These are important\nconditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be\nin material breach of its terms.\n\n4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You\nmust: \n\n  a. Do so only under the terms of this License or another license\n  permitted under Section 4.4;\n\n  b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license\n  permitted under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n  with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the\n  Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and\n\n  c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices\n  that refer to this License.\n\n  d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular\n  file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a\n  location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to\n  look for it.\n\n4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced\nWork does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you\nPublicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with\nthe Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,\nviews, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced\nWork aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it\nis available under this License.\n\n  a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under\n  Section 4.3:\n\n        Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available\n        here under the Open Database License (ODbL).\n\nDATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a\nhyperlink to the URI of the Database. \"Open Database License\" should\ncontain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If\nhyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the\nrequired URI's with the above notice.\n \n4.4 Share alike. \n\n  a. Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under\n  the terms of: \n\n    i. This License;\n\n    ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this\n      License; or\n\n    iii. A compatible license. \n\n  If You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses\n  mentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license. \n\n  b. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the\n  whole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a\n  Derivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4. \n\n  c. Derivative Databases and Produced Works.  A Derivative Database is\n  Publicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work\n  created from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.\n\n  d. Share Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt,\n  You must not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a\n  that are incompatible with the rights granted under this License. \n\n  e. Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine\n  compatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the\n  authorised proxy's public statement of acceptance of a compatible\n  license grants You permission to use the compatible license.\n\n\n4.5 Limits of Share Alike.  The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply\nin the following:\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license\n  Collective Databases under this License if You incorporate this\n  Database or a Derivative Database in the collection, but this License\n  still applies to this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of\n  the Collective Database; \n\n  b. Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as\n  part of a Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not\n  create a Derivative Database for purposes of  Section 4.4; and\n\n  c. Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is\n  not to the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements\n  of Section 4.4.\n\n4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a Derivative\nDatabase or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also\noffer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy\nin a machine readable form of:\n\n  a. The entire Derivative Database; or\n\n  b. A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or\n  the method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an\n  algorithm), including any additional Contents, that make up all the\n  differences between the Database and the Derivative Database.\n\nThe Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be\navailable at no more than a reasonable production cost for physical\ndistributions and free of charge if distributed over the internet.\n\n4.7 Technological measures and additional terms\n\n  a. This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to\n  Section 4.7 b.)  any terms or any technological measures on the\n  Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of\n  the Contents that alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any\n  rights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting\n  the ability of any person to exercise those rights.\n\n  b. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or technological\n  measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a\n  Substantial part of the Contents (a \"Restricted Database\") in\n  contravention of Section 4.74 a. only if You also make a copy of the\n  Database or a Derivative Database available to the recipient of the\n  Restricted Database:\n\n    i. That is available without additional fee;\n\n    ii. That is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict\n    the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have\n    the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to\n    exercise those rights (an \"Unrestricted Database\"); and\n\n    iii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the\n    recipient as a practical matter as the Restricted Database.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a\n  Derivative Database in an authenticated environment, behind a\n  password, or within a similar access control scheme provided that You\n  do not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any rights\n  granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the\n  ability of any person to exercise those rights. \n\n4.8 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time\nYou communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the\nContents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the\nLicensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same\nterms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for\nenforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may\nenforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are\nsolely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made\nby You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any\nfurther restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed\nunder this License.\n\n### 5.0 Moral rights\n\n5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights\nto be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment\nthat would otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or\nany other derogatory treatment:\n\n  a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives\n  all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest\n  extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section\n  10.4; \n\n  b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant\n  jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral\n  rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the\n  fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under\n  Section 10.4; and\n\n  c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert\n  moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their\n  moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.\n\nPlease note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral\nrights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some\njurisdictions.\n\n### 6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected \n\n6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may\nindependently have under any applicable law to make any use of this\nDatabase, including without limitation:\n\n  a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents\n  from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for\n  purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and\n  Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative\n  or judicial procedure. \n\n  b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation\n  or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws. \n\n6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract\nand Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated\nquantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including\ncreating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the\nContents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or\nRe-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount\nto the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the\nContents.\n\n### 7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer\n\n7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor \"as is\" and without any\nwarranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute,\ncustom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically\ndisclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title,\nnon-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of\nerrors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so\nthis exclusion may not apply to You.\n\n### 8.0 Limitation of liability\n\n8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law,\nthe Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability\nfor loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use\nunder this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused\nby any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of\nliability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental,\nconsequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue,\ndata, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies\neven if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such\ndamages.\n\n8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and\ndirect financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on\nthe part of the Licensor.\n\n### 9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License\n\n9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License\nautomatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without\nnotice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the\nDatabase, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative\nDatabases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You\nunder this License will not have their licenses terminated provided\ntheir use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted\nunder Section 4.8 of this License.  Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will\nsurvive any termination of this License.\n\n9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor\nwill not terminate Your rights under it. \n\n9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You\nfor the duration of applicable rights in the Database. \n\n9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and\nconditions of this License, then your full rights under this License\nwill be reinstated:\n\n  a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th\n  day after cessation of breach; \n\n  b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless\n  otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or\n\n  c.  Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the\n  violation, this is the first time You have received notice of\n  violation of this License from  the Licensor, and You cure the\n  violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nPersons subject to permanent termination of rights are not eligible to\nbe a recipient and receive a license under Section 4.8.\n\n9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release\nthe Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or\nmaking available the Database. Releasing the Database under different\nlicense terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not\nwithdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\nrequired to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\nLicense will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\nstated above.\n\n### 10.0 General\n\n10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or\nunenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each\nremaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the\nfullest extent permitted by law. \n\n10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with\nrespect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any\nearlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to\nthe Database. \n\n10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be\nentitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any\nbreach by the Licensor. \n\n10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by\nthe laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are\nsought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under\napplicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant\njurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License,\nthese additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the\nterms of this License.\n",

DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS. \n\n    3.1 Application of License. \n\n      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed \n      by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. \n      The Source Code version of Covered Software may be distributed only under \n      the terms of this License or a future version of this License released \n      under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every \n      copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any \n      terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable \n      version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You \n      may include an additional document offering the additional rights \n      described in Section 3.5. \n\n    3.2 Availability of Source Code. \n\n      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made \n      available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on \n      the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic \n      Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version \n      available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, \n      must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it \n      initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent \n      version of that particular Modification has been made available to such \n      recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version \n      remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is \n      maintained by a third party. \n\n    3.3 Description of Modifications. \n\n      You must cause all Covered Software to which You contribute to contain a \n      file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Software and \n      the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the \n      Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software \n      provided by Nokia and including the name of Nokia in (a) the Source Code, \n      and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in \n      which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Software. \n\n    3.4 Intellectual Property Matters \n\n      a) Third Party Claims. \n\n        If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's \n        intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted \n        by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include \n        a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL'' which \n        describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail \n        that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such \n        knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in \n        Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all \n        copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps \n        (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably \n        calculated to inform those who received the Covered Software that new \n        knowledge has been obtained. \n\n      b) Contributor APIs. \n\n        If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming \n        interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are \n        reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also \n        include this information in the LEGAL file. \n\n      c) Representations. \n\n        Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section \n        3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are \n        Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient \n        rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. \n\n    3.5 Required Notices. \n\n      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source \n      Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code \n      file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location \n      (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for \n      such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your \n      name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also \n      duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You \n      describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered \n      Software. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, \n      support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of \n      Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not \n      on behalf of Nokia or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear \n      that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is \n      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every \n      Contributor for any liability incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a \n      result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. \n\n    3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions. \n\n      You may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the \n      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Software, \n      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the \n      Covered Software is available under the terms of this License, including a \n      description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section \n      3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an \n      Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You \n      describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Software. You may \n      distribute the Executable version of Covered Software or ownership rights \n      under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from \n      this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this \n      License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt \n      to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from \n      the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable \n      version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that \n      any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by \n      Nokia or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every \n      Contributor for any liability incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a \n      result of any such terms You offer. \n\n    3.7 Larger Works. \n\n      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other \n      software not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the \n      Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the \n      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software. \n\n  4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION. \n\n    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License \n    with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial \n    order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this \n    License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and \n    the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file \n    described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the \n    Source Code. \n\n    Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description \n    must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able \n    to understand it. \n\n  5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE. \n\n    This License applies to code to which Nokia has attached the notice in \n    Exhibit A and to related Covered Software. \n\n  6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE. \n\n    6.1 New Versions. \n\n      Nokia may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to \n      time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. \n\n    6.2 Effect of New Versions. \n\n      Once Covered Software has been published under a particular version of the \n      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that \n      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Software under the terms \n      of any subsequent version of the License published by Nokia. No one other \n      than Nokia has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered \n      Software created under this License. \n\n  7.

TERMINATION. \n\n    8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate \n    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such \n    breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to \n    the Covered Software which are properly granted shall survive any \n    termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain \n    in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. \n\n    8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim \n    (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Nokia or a Contributor (Nokia \n    or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \n    \"Participant\") alleging that: \n\n      a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes \n      any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You \n      under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice \n      from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after \n      receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a \n      mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of \n      Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation \n      claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If \n      within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are \n      not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim \n      is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections \n      2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day \n      notice period specified above. \n\n      b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's \n      Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any \n      rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) \n      are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, \n      distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. \n\n    8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging \n    that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes \n    any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) \n    prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the \n    reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections \n    2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of \n    any payment or license. \n\n    8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end \n    user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have \n    been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to \n    termination shall survive termination. \n\n  9.

THIS \n    LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL \n    INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW \n    PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR \n    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, BUT MAY ALLOW LIABILITY \n    TO BE LIMITED; IN SUCH CASES, A PARTY's, ITS EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS OR \n    AFFILIATES' LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO U.S. $50.

All rights in the Covered Software not expressly granted under this \n    License are reserved. Nothing in this License shall grant You any rights to \n    use any of the trademarks of Nokia or any of its Affiliates, even if any of \n    such trademarks are included in any part of Covered Software and/or \n    documentation to it. \n\n    This License is governed by the laws of Finland excluding its \n    conflict-of-law provisions.

The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a\n      Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work\n      apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of\n      this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from\n      any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from\n      the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the\n      Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work,\n      upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n      practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to\n      such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.\n    \n   b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or\n      publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the\n      terms of this License, a later version of this License with the\n      same License Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons\n      iCommons license that contains the same License Elements as this\n      License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Japan). You must\n      include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this\n      License or other license specified in the previous sentence with\n      every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You\n      distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n      digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the\n      Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this\n      License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\n      hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to\n      this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not\n      distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n      digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological\n      measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner\n      inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above\n      applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective\n      Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from\n      the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of\n      this License.\n    \n   c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or\n      publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or\n      Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for\n      the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the\n      medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or\n      pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the\n      title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably\n      practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that\n      Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such\n      URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing\n      information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work,\n      a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work\n      (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or\n      \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). Such\n      credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,\n      however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective\n      Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other\n      comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as\n      prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS\nTHE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND\nCONCERNING THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\nINCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\nLATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF\nERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW\nTHE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY\nTO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY\nLEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR\nEXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,\nEVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this\n      License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative\n      Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however,\n      will not have their licenses terminated provided such\n      individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those\n      licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any\n      termination of this License.\n    \n   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted\n      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright\n      in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the\n      right to release the Work under different license terms or to\n      stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that\n      any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or\n      any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted\n      under the terms of this License), and this License will continue\n      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n   a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work\n      or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a\n      license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the\n      license granted to You under this License.\n\n   b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a\n      Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to\n      the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the\n      license granted to You under this License.\n    \n   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable\n      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or\n      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,\n      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,\n      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary\n      to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n    \n   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and\n      no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in\n      writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver\n      or consent.\n    \n   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the\n      parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no\n      understandings, agreements or representations with respect to\n      the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any\n      additional provisions that may appear in any communication from\n      You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written\n      agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\nwhatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be\nliable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages\nwhatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,\nincidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this\nlicense. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative\nCommons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it\nshall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the\nWork is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark\n\"Creative Commons\" or any related trademark or logo of Creative\nCommons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any\npermitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons'\nthen-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its\nwebsite or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.\n\nCreative Commons may be contacted at https://creativecommons.org/.\n",
  "GPLv3orlater": " GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n",

DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n    documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n\n    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n\n    i) changes to the Program, and\n\n    ii) additions to the Program;\n\n    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\n    and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n    'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\n    such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's\n    behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program\n    which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\n    conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,\n    and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor\nwhich are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution\nalone or when combined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\nAgreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this\nAgreement, including all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n    copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,\n    publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the\n    Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative\n    works, in source code and object code form.\n\n    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n    license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such\n    Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This\n    patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution\n    and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the\n    Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\n    combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent\n    license shall not apply to any other combinations which include\n    the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\n    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other\n    entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for\n    claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\n    intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to\n    exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each\n    Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other\n    intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n    third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\n    distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to\n    acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\n    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n    sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n    the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form\nunder its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;\n    and\n\n    b) its license agreement:\n\n    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n    warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n    warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n    implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n    for a particular purpose;\n\n    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all\n    liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement\n    are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;\n    and\n\n    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n    Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\n    reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for\n    software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\n    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the\n    Program.\n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\nwithin the Program.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\nContribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\nRecipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain\nresponsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the\nlike. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use\nof the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a\ncommercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not\ncreate potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a\nContributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,\nsuch Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend\nand indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\")\nagainst any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising\nfrom claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party\nagainst the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts\nor omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its\ndistribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The\nobligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\ninfringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)\npromptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,\nand b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with\nthe Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\nclaim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those\nperformance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\nContributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor\nmust pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\nPROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY\nWARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\nOR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely\nresponsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\ndistributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\nexercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to\nthe risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable\nlaws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and\nunavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\nANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\nINCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\nWITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\nLIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\nNEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR\nDISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED\nHEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nthe Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other\nsoftware or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such\nRecipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of\nthe date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably\npracticable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and\nany licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall\ncontinue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\nmay only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\nreserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\nthis Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\nSteward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\nis the initial Agreement Steward.

Each new version of the Agreement will be given a\ndistinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)\nmay always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\nunder which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the\nAgreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the\nProgram (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as\nexpressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives\nno rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor\nunder this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or\notherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this\nAgreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and\nthe intellectual property laws of the United States of America.

Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code\n               or previous Modifications.\n\n        1.10. \"Original Code\" means Source Code of computer software code\n        which is described in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A\n        as Original Code, and which, at the time of its release under this\n        License is not already Covered Code governed by this License.\n\n        1.11. \"Source Code\" means the preferred form of the Covered Code\n        for making modifications to it, including all modules it contains,\n        plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to\n        control compilation and installation of an Executable, or a list of\n        source code differential comparisons against either the Original\n        Code or another well known, available Covered Code of the\n        Contributor's choice. The Source Code can be in a compressed or\n        archival form, provided the appropriate decompression or\n        de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.\n\n        1.12. \"You\" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights\n        under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a\n        future version of this License issued under Section 6.1.

Distribution Obligations.\n\n        3.1. Application of License.\n        The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\n        governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation\n        Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\n        distributed only under the terms of this License or a future\n        version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must\n        include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code\n        You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source\n        Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of\n        this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may\n        include an additional document offering the additional rights\n        described in Section 3.5.\n\n        3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n        Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must\n        be made available, prior to any use, except for internal\n        development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of\n        this License either on the same media as an Executable version or\n        via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom\n        you made an Executable version available; and if made available via\n        Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at\n        least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became\n        available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of\n        that particular Modification has been made available to such\n        recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the\n        Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact\n        means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial\n        Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may\n        provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification\n        to be made available.\n\n        3.3. Description of Modifications.\n        You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain\n        a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code\n        and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement\n        that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from\n        Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the\n        name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in\n        any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in\n        which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n        3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n\n               (a) Third Party Claims.\n               If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual\n               property right in particular functionality or code (or its\n               utilization under this License), you must include a text\n               file with the source code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which\n               describes the claim and the party making the claim in\n               sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to\n               contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your\n               Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You\n               shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make\n               available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as\n               notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\n               reasonably calculated to inform those who received the\n               Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n        (b) Representations.\n\n               Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\n               Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that\n               Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original\n               creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to\n               grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n        3.5. Required Notices.\n        You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the\n        Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source\n        Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered\n        Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your\n        name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it\n        is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file\n        due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a\n        location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be\n        likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to\n        charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n        obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\n        may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\n        Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear\n        that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation\n        is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the\n        Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\n        by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of\n        warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n        3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n        You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n        requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered\n        Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code\n        version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this\n        License, including a description of how and where You have\n        fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be\n        conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,\n        related documentation or collateral in which You describe\n        recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute\n        the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your\n        choice, which may contain terms different from this License,\n        provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License\n        and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to\n        limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version\n        from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the\n        Executable version under a different license You must make it\n        absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are\n        offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any\n        Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer\n        and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\n        Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You\n        offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered\n        Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the\n        documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.\n\n        3.7. Larger Works.\n        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other\n        code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the\n        Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure\n        the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered\n        Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n        If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n        License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\n        statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of\n        this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of\n        the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully\n        with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they\n        affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file\n        described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all\n        distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited\n        by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently\n        detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand\n        it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\n        This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n        attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n        6.1. New Versions.\n        License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the\n        License from time to time. Each version will be given a\n        distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to\n        opensource.org for certification.\n\n        6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n        Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\n        the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of\n        that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under\n        the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by\n        Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the\n        right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under\n        this License.\n\n        6.3. Derivative Works.\n        If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in\n        association with the required Developer Specific License described\n        in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code\n        which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you\n        must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open'',\n        ``OpenPL'', ``OPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear\n        anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your\n        version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open\n        Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,\n        Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A\n        shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this\n        License.)\n\n6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License\n\n        This license is a union of the following two parts that should be\n        found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of\n        preeminence:\n\n           [1] A Developer specific license.\n\n           [2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general\n           licensing policy of the software.\n\n        In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license,\n        the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by\n        the terms of the higher numbered part.\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n        COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n        WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n        WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\n        DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\n        NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\n        THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE\n        DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER\n        CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\n        CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART\n        OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER\n        EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n        8.1 Termination upon Breach\n\n        This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n        such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.  All\n        sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall\n        survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their\n        nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\n        shall survive.\n\n         \n\n        8.2.  Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by\n        asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment\n        actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial\n        Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred\n        to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\n\n               (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\n               indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights\n               granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or\n               2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant\n               terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt\n               of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a\n               mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future\n               use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw\n               Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version\n               against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a\n               reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually\n               agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\n               is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You\n               under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the\n               expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n               (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such\n               Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly\n               infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such\n               Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked\n               effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,\n               distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\n               Participant.\n\n        8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n        alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\n        indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\n        by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n        infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n        granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n        into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n        license.\n\n        8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all\n        end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\n        which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\n        prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n         \n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL\n        DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\n        OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER\n        PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\n        OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF\n        GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND\n        ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE\n        BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n        LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\n        RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\n        PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n        EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\n        THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n        The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in\n        48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct.  1995), consisting of ``commercial computer\n        software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such\n        terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\n        C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\n        all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\n        rights set forth herein.\n\n11.

You agree to work with affected parties to distribute with\n        Initial Developer responsibility on an equitable basis.\n\nEXHIBIT A.\n\n        Text for this Exhibit A is found in the corresponding addendum,\n        described in section 6.4 above, text file provided by the Initial\n        Developer.

Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make\nsure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free\nsoftware, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\nthat you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free\nprograms; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must tell them their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be\ndistributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The\n\"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\non the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each\nlicensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\nGeneral Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\nother recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License\nalong with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of\ntransferring a copy.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\nit, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph\n1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\n    you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n\n    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that\n    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either\n    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all\n    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except\n    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all\n    third parties, at your option).\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\n    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use\n    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General\n    Public License.\n\n    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\n    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in\n    exchange for a fee.\n\nMere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its\nderivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\nthe other work under the scope of these terms.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of\nit, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nParagraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge\n    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the\n    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\nSource code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special\nexception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard\nlibraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable\nfile runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that\naccompany that operating system.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the\nProgram except as expressly provided under this General Public License.\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer\nthe Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use\nthe Program under this License.  However, parties who have received\ncopies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties\nremain in full compliance.\n\n  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based\non the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,\nand all its terms and conditions.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original\nlicensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\nterms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the\nrecipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthe license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\nterms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to\nattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\nthe exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)\n    any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

  "GPLv2": " GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 2, June 1991\n\n Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Phrase \"Based on TrueCrypt, freely available at\n    http://www.truecrypt.org/\" must be displayed by Your Product\n    (if technically feasible) and contained in its\n    documentation. Alternatively, if This Product or its portion\n    You included in Your Product constitutes only a minor\n    portion of Your Product, phrase \"Portions of this product\n    are based in part on TrueCrypt, freely available at\n    http://www.truecrypt.org/\" may be displayed instead. In each\n    of the cases mentioned above in this paragraph,\n    \"http://www.truecrypt.org/\" must be a hyperlink (if\n    technically feasible) pointing to http://www.truecrypt.org/\n    and You may freely choose the location within the user\n    interface (if there is any) of Your Product (e.g., an\n    \"About\" window, etc.) and the way in which Your Product will\n    display the respective phrase.\n\n    Your Product (and any associated materials, e.g., the\n    documentation, the content of the official web site of Your\n    Product, etc.) must not present any Internet address\n    containing the domain name truecrypt.org (or any domain name\n    that forwards to the domain name truecrypt.org) in a manner\n    that might suggest that it is where information about Your\n    Product may be obtained or where bugs found in Your Product\n    may be reported or where support for Your Product may be\n    available or otherwise attempt to indicate that the domain\n    name truecrypt.org is associated with Your Product.\n\n    d. The complete source code of Your Product must be freely\n    and publicly available (for exceptions, see Section III.2)\n    at least until You cease to distribute Your Product. This\n    condition can be met in one or both of the following ways:\n    (i) You include the complete source code of Your Product\n    with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute\n    and You make all such copies of Your Product available to\n    the general public free of charge, and/or (ii) You include\n    information (valid and correct at least until You cease to\n    distribute Your Product) about where the complete source\n    code of Your Product can be obtained free of charge (e.g.,\n    an Internet address) or for a reasonable reproduction fee\n    with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute\n    and, if there is a web site officially associated with Your\n    Product, You include the aforementioned information about\n    the source code on a freely and publicly accessible web\n    page to which such web site links via an easily viewable\n    hyperlink (at least until You cease to distribute Your\n    Product).\n\n    The source code of Your Product must not be deliberately\n    obfuscated and it must not be in an intermediate form (e.g.,\n    the output of a preprocessor). Source code means the\n    preferred form in which a programmer would usually modify\n    the program.\n\n    Portions of the source code of Your Product not contained in\n    This Product (e.g., portions added by You in creating Your\n    Product, whether created by You or by third parties) must be\n    available under license(s) that (however, see also\n    Subsection III.1.e) allow(s) anyone to modify and derive new\n    works from the portions of the source code that are not\n    contained in This Product and to use, copy, and redistribute\n    such modifications and/or derivative works. The license(s)\n    must be perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, no-charge,\n    and worldwide, and must not invalidate, weaken, restrict,\n    interpret, amend, modify, interfere with or otherwise affect\n    any part, term, provision, or clause of this License. The\n    text(s) of the license(s) must be included with every copy\n    of Your Product that You make and distribute.\n\n    e. You must not change the license terms of This Product in\n    any way (adding any new terms is considered changing the\n    license terms even if the original terms are retained),\n    which means, e.g., that no part of This Product may be put\n    under another license. You must keep intact all the legal\n    notices contained in the source code files. You must include\n    the following items with every copy of Your Product that You\n    make and distribute: a clear and conspicuous notice stating\n    that Your Product or portion(s) thereof is/are governed by\n    this version of the TrueCrypt License, a verbatim copy of\n    this version of the TrueCrypt License (as contained herein),\n    a clear and conspicuous notice containing information about\n    where the included copy of the License can be found, and an\n    appropriate copyright notice.\n\n\n2. You are not obligated to comply with Subsection III.1.d if\nYour Product is not distributed (i.e., Your Product is available\nonly to You).\n\n\n\nIV.

Distribution Obligations.  \n\n3.1 Application of License.  The Modifications which You create or to\nwhich You contribute are governed by the terms of this License,\nincluding without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of\nCovered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License\nor a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and\nYou must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source\nCode You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any\nSource Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of\nthis License or the recipientsâ€™ rights hereunder. However, You may\ninclude an additional document offering the additional rights\ndescribed in Section 3.5.  \n\n3.2 Availability of Source Code.  \n\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\nmade available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\neither on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\nElectronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\nExecutable version available; and if made available via Electronic\nDistribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\nmonths after the date it initially became available, or at least six\n(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\nhas been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\nensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\nElectronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.  \n\n3.3 Description of Modifications.  \n\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\nfile documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\nthe date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\nthe Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\nCode provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\nInitial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\nExecutable version or related documentation in which You describe the\norigin or ownership of the Covered Code.  \n\n3.4 Intellectual Property Matters \n\n(a) Third Party Claims.  \n\nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partyâ€™s\nintellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\ngranted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor\nmust include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled\nâ€œLEGALâ€� which describes the claim and the party making the claim in\nsufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If\nContributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made\navailable as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly\nmodify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available\nthereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate\nmailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who\nreceived the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.  \n\n(b) Contributor APIs.  \n\nIf Contributorâ€™s Modifications include an application programming\ninterface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are\nreasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also\ninclude this information in the LEGAL file.  \n\n(c) Representations.\n\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section\n3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributorâ€™s Modifications\nare Contributorâ€™s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has\nsufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.  \n\n3.5 Required Notices.  \n\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\nCode. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\nCode file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\nlocation (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\nto look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)\nYou may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\nExhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\nfor the Source Code where You describe recipientsâ€™ rights or ownership\nrights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to\ncharge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\nobligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\nmay do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\nDeveloper or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\nany such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\noffered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\nDeveloper and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\nInitial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability terms You offer.  \n\n3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.  \n\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\nrequirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\nand if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\nthe Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\nincluding a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\nobligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\nin any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\ncollateral in which You describe recipientsâ€™ rights relating to the\nCovered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\nCode or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\ncontain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\ncompliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\nExecutable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipientâ€™s\nrights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\nLicense. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\nlicense You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\nfrom this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\nDeveloper, Original Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to\nindemnify the Initial Developer, Original Developer and every\nContributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer,\nOriginal Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms\nYou offer.  \n\n3.7 Larger Works.  \n\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\nnot governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\nWork as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\nrequirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.  \n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\nmust be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\nbe included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\nextent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\nsufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\nunderstand it.  \n\n5. Application of this License.  \n\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\nattached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.  \n\n6.1 New Versions.  \n\nSocialtext, Inc. (â€œSocialtextâ€�) may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given\na distinguishing version number.  \n\n6.2 Effect of New Versions.  \n\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the\nLicense, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\nversion. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\nof any subsequent version of the License published by Socialtext. No\none other than Socialtext has the right to modify the terms applicable\nto Covered Code created under this License.  \n\n6.3 Derivative Works.  \n\nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\nonly do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\ngoverned by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\nthe phrases â€œSocialtextâ€�, â€œCPALâ€� or any confusingly similar phrase do\nnot appear in your license (except to note that your license differs\nfrom this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version\nof the license contains terms which differ from the CPAL. (Filling in\nthe name of the Initial Developer, Original Developer, Original Code\nor Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of\nthemselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  \n\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN â€œAS ISâ€� BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\nWITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\nDEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\nNON-INFRINGING.

SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE\nIN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL DEVELOPER OR\nANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN\nESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS\nAUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.  \n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\nautomatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\nsuch breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\nsublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\nsurvive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\nnature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\nshall survive.\n\n8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\nclaim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial\nDeveloper, Original Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer,\nOriginal Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is\nreferred to as â€œParticipantâ€�) alleging that: (a) such Participantâ€™s\nContributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\nany and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections\n2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from\nParticipant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after\nreceipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant\na mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use\nof Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your\nlitigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such\nParticipant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and\npayment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the\nparties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted\nby Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically\nterminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified\nabove.  (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such\nParticipantâ€™s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes\nany patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under\nSections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You\nfirst made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made\nby that Participant.  \n\n8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\nalleging that such Participantâ€™s Contributor Version directly or\nindirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\nby license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\ninfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\ngranted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\ninto account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\nlicense.  8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2\nabove, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and\nresellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor\nhereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  \n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\nDEVELOPER, ORIGINAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY\nDISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES,\nBE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\nDAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR\nMALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN\nIF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR\nDEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYâ€™S NEGLIGENCE TO THE\nEXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO\nNOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\nDAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.  The Covered Code is a â€œcommercial\nitem,â€� as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995),\nconsisting of â€œcommercial computer softwareâ€� and â€œcommercial computer\nsoftware documentation,â€� as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212\n(Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48\nC.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government\nEnd Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth\nherein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.  \n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\nCalifornia law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if\nany, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law\nprovisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a\ncitizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the\nUnited States of America, any litigation relating to this License\nshall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the\nNorthern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara\nCounty, California, with the losing party responsible for costs,\nincluding without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneysâ€™\nfees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\nContracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly\nexcluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a\ncontract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to\nthis License.  \n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.  \n\nAs between Initial Developer, Original Developer and the Contributors,\neach party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or\nindirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and\nYou agree to work with Initial Developer, Original Developer and\nContributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable\nbasis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any\nadmission of liability.  \n\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.  \n\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\nMultiple-Licensed. Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer\npermits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice\nof the CPAL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the\nInitial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.  \n\n14. ADDITIONAL TERM: ATTRIBUTION \n\n(a) As a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the\nOriginal Code (â€œOriginal Developerâ€�), in the hope that its promotional\nvalue may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing\nthe Original Code, the Original Developer may include in Exhibit B\n(â€œAttribution Informationâ€�) a requirement that each time an Executable\nand Source Code or a Larger Work is launched or initially run (which\nincludes initiating a session), a prominent display of the Original\nDeveloperâ€™s Attribution Information (as defined below) must occur on\nthe graphic user interface employed by the end user to access such\nCovered Code (which may include display on a splash screen), if\nany. The size of the graphic image should be consistent with the size\nof the other elements of the Attribution Information. If the access by\nthe end user to the Executable and Source Code does not create a\ngraphic user interface for access to the Covered Code, this obligation\nshall not apply. If the Original Code displays such Attribution\nInformation in a particular form (such as in the form of a splash\nscreen, notice at login, an â€œaboutâ€� display, or dedicated attribution\narea on user interface screens), continued use of such form for that\nAttribution Information is one way of meeting this requirement for\nnotice.  \n\n(b) Attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a\nbrief phrase, graphic image and a URL (â€œAttribution Informationâ€�) and\nis subject to the Attribution Limits as defined below. For these\npurposes, prominent shall mean display for sufficient duration to give\nreasonable notice to the user of the identity of the Original\nDeveloper and that if You include Attribution Information or similar\ninformation for other parties, You must ensure that the Attribution\nInformation for the Original Developer shall be no less prominent than\nsuch Attribution Information or similar information for the other\nparty. For greater certainty, the Original Developer may choose to\nspecify in Exhibit B below that the above attribution requirement only\napplies to an Executable and Source Code resulting from the Original\nCode or any Modification, but not a Larger Work. The intent is to\nprovide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore the Original\nDeveloper cannot require that You display, at any time, more than the\nfollowing information as Attribution Information: (a) a copyright\nnotice including the name of the Original Developer; (b) a word or one\nphrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one graphic image provided by the\nOriginal Developer; and (d) a URL (collectively, the â€œAttribution\nLimitsâ€�).\n\n(c) If Exhibit B does not include any Attribution Information, then\nthere are no requirements for You to display any Attribution\nInformation of the Original Developer.\n\n(d) You acknowledge that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade\nnames contained within the Attribution Information distributed with\nthe Covered Code are the exclusive property of their owners and may\nonly be used with the permission of their owners, or under\ncircumstances otherwise permitted by law or as expressly set out in\nthis License.  \n\n15. ADDITIONAL TERM: NETWORK USE.  The term â€œExternal Deploymentâ€�\nmeans the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Code or\nModifications in any way such that the Original Code or Modifications\nmay be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are\ndistributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an\napplication intended for use over a network. As an express condition\nfor the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External\nDeployment by You of the Original Code or Modifications as a\ndistribution under section 3.1 and make Source Code available under\nSection 3.2.\n\nEXHIBIT A.

You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code \n\tversion that alters or restricts the applicable version of this \n\tLicense or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include \n\tan additional document offering the additional rights described in \n\tSection 3.5. \n\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n\n\tAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be \n\tmade available in Source Code form under the terms of this License \n\teither on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted \n\tElectronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an \n\tExecutable version available; and if made available via Electronic \n\tDistribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) \n\tmonths after the date it initially became available, or at least six \n\t(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification \n\thas been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for \n\tensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the \n\tElectronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. \n\n3.3. Description of Modifications.\n\n\tYou must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a \n\tfile documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and \n\tthe date of any change.

Versions of the License. \n\n6.1. New Versions.\n\n\tSun Microsystems, Inc. (\"Sun\") may publish revised and/or new versions \n\tof the License from time to time. Each version will be given a \n\tdistinguishing version number. \n\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n\tOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the \n\tLicense, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that \n\tversion.

  "FAL1.3": " Free Art License 1.3\n\n\n[ Copyleft Attitude ]\n\nFree Art License 1.3 (FAL 1.3)\n\nPreamble\n\nThe Free Art License grants the right to freely copy, distribute, and\ntransform creative works without infringing the author's rights.\n\nThe Free Art License recognizes and protects these rights. Their\nimplementation has been reformulated in order to allow everyone to use\ncreations of the human mind in a creative manner, regardless of their\ntypes and ways of expression.\n\nWhile the public's access to creations of the human mind usually is\nrestricted by the implementation of copyright law, it is favoured by\nthe Free Art License. This license intends to allow the use of a\nworkâ€™s resources; to establish new conditions for creating in order to\nincrease creation opportunities. The Free Art License grants the right\nto use a work, and acknowledges the right holderâ€™s and the userâ€™s\nrights and responsibility.\n\nThe invention and development of digital technologies, Internet and\nFree Software have changed creation methods: creations of the human\nmind can obviously be distributed, exchanged, and transformed. They\nallow to produce common works to which everyone can contribute to the\nbenefit of all.\n\nThe main rationale for this Free Art License is to promote and protect\nthese creations of the human mind according to the principles of\ncopyleft: freedom to use, copy, distribute, transform, and prohibition\nof exclusive appropriation.\n\nDefinitions\n\nâ€œworkâ€� either means the initial work, the subsequent works or the\ncommon work as defined hereafter:\n\nâ€œcommon workâ€� means a work composed of the initial work and all\nsubsequent contributions to it (originals and copies). The initial\nauthor is the one who, by choosing this license, defines the\nconditions under which contributions are made.\n\nâ€œInitial workâ€� means the work created by the initiator of the common\nwork (as defined above), the copies of which can be modified by\nwhoever wants to\n\nâ€œSubsequent worksâ€� means the contributions made by authors who\nparticipate in the evolution of the common work by exercising the\nrights to reproduce, distribute, and modify that are granted by the\nlicense.\n\nâ€œOriginalsâ€� (sources or resources of the work) means all copies of\neither the initial work or any subsequent work mentioning a date and\nused by their author(s) as references for any subsequent updates,\ninterpretations, copies or reproductions.\n\nâ€œCopyâ€� means any reproduction of an original as defined by this license.\n\n1. OBJECT \n\nThe aim of this license is to define the conditions under which one\ncan use this work freely.\n\n2. SCOPE \n\nThis work is subject to copyright law. Through this license its author\nspecifies the extent to which you can copy, distribute, and modify it.\n\n2.1 FREEDOM TO COPY (OR TO MAKE REPRODUCTIONS) \n\nYou have the right to copy this work for yourself, your friends or any\nother person, whatever the technique used.\n\n2.2 FREEDOM TO DISTRIBUTE, TO PERFORM IN PUBLIC \n\nYou have the right to distribute copies of this work; whether modified\nor not, whatever the medium and the place, with or without any charge,\nprovided that you: attach this license without any modification to the\ncopies of this work or indicate precisely where the license can be\nfound, specify to the recipient the names of the author(s) of the\noriginals, including yours if you have modified the work, specify to\nthe recipient where to access the originals (either initial or\nsubsequent).  The authors of the originals may, if they wish to, give\nyou the right to distribute the originals under the same conditions as\nthe copies.\n\n2.3 FREEDOM TO MODIFY \n\nYou have the right to modify copies of the originals (whether initial\nor subsequent) provided you comply with the following conditions: all\nconditions in article 2.2 above, if you distribute modified copies;\nindicate that the work has been modified and, if it is possible, what\nkind of modifications have been made; distribute the subsequent work\nunder the same license or any compatible license.  The author(s) of\nthe original work may give you the right to modify it under the same\nconditions as the copies.\n\n3. RELATED RIGHTS\n\nActivities giving rise to authorâ€™s rights and related rights shall not\nchallenge the rights granted by this license.  For example, this is\nthe reason why performances must be subject to the same license or a\ncompatible license. Similarly, integrating the work in a database, a\ncompilation or an anthology shall not prevent anyone from using the\nwork under the same conditions as those defined in this license.\n\n4.

PREAMBLE.\n\nCopyright law gives certain exclusive rights to the author of a work,\nincluding the rights to copy, modify and distribute the work (the\n\"reproductive,\" \"adaptative,\" and \"distribution\" rights).\n\nThe idea of \"copyleft\" is to willfully revoke the exclusivity of those\nrights under certain terms and conditions, so that anyone can copy and\ndistribute the work or properly attributed derivative works, while all\ncopies remain under the same terms and conditions as the original.\n\nThe intent of this license is to be a general \"copyleft\" that can be\napplied to any kind of work that has protection under copyright. This\nlicense states those certain conditions under which a work published\nunder its terms may be copied, distributed, and modified.\n\nWhereas \"design science\" is a strategy for the development of\nartifacts as a way to reform the environment (not people) and\nsubsequently improve the universal standard of living, this Design\nScience License was written and deployed as a strategy for promoting\nthe progress of science and art through reform of the environment.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS.\n\n\"License\" shall mean this Design Science License. The License applies\nto any work which contains a notice placed by the work's copyright\nholder stating that it is published under the terms of this Design\nScience License.\n\n\"Work\" shall mean such an aforementioned work. The License also\napplies to the output of the Work, only if said output constitutes a\n\"derivative work\" of the licensed Work as defined by copyright law.\n\n\"Object Form\" shall mean an executable or performable form of the\nWork, being an embodiment of the Work in some tangible medium.\n\n\"Source Data\" shall mean the origin of the Object Form, being the\nentire, machine-readable, preferred form of the Work for copying and\nfor human modification (usually the language, encoding or format in\nwhich composed or recorded by the Author); plus any accompanying\nfiles, scripts or other data necessary for installation, configuration\nor compilation of the Work.\n\n(Examples of \"Source Data\" include, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing: if the Work is an image file composed and edited in PNG\nformat, then the original PNG source file is the Source Data; if the\nWork is an MPEG 1.0 layer 3 digital audio recording made from a WAV\nformat audio file recording of an analog source, then the original WAV\nfile is the Source Data; if the Work was composed as an unformatted\nplaintext file, then that file is the Source Data; if the Work was\ncomposed in LaTeX, the LaTeX file(s) and any image files and/or custom\nmacros necessary for compilation constitute the Source Data.)\n\n\"Author\" shall mean the copyright holder(s) of the Work. The\nindividual licensees are referred to as \"you.\"\n\n2. RIGHTS AND COPYRIGHT.\n\nThe Work is copyrighted by the Author. All rights to the Work are\nreserved by the Author, except as specifically described below. This\nLicense describes the terms and conditions under which the Author\npermits you to copy, distribute and modify copies of the Work.\n\nIn addition, you may refer to the Work, talk about it, and (as\ndictated by \"fair use\") quote from it, just as you would any\ncopyrighted material under copyright law.\n\nYour right to operate, perform, read or otherwise interpret and/or\nexecute the Work is unrestricted; however, you do so at your own risk,\nbecause the Work comes WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY -- see Section 7 (\"NO\nWARRANTY\") below.\n\n3. COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION.\n\nPermission is granted to distribute, publish or otherwise present\nverbatim copies of the entire Source Data of the Work, in any medium,\nprovided that full copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty, where\napplicable, is conspicuously published on all copies, and a copy of\nthis License is distributed along with the Work.\n\nPermission is granted to distribute, publish or otherwise present\ncopies of the Object Form of the Work, in any medium, under the terms\nfor distribution of Source Data above and also provided that one of\nthe following additional conditions are met:\n\n(a) The Source Data is included in the same distribution, distributed\nunder the terms of this License; or\n\n(b) A written offer is included with the distribution, valid for at\nleast three years or for as long as the distribution is in print\n(whichever is longer), with a publicly-accessible address (such as a\nURL on the Internet) where, for a charge not greater than\ntransportation and media costs, anyone may receive a copy of the\nSource Data of the Work distributed according to the section above; or\n\n(c) A third party's written offer for obtaining the Source Data at no\ncost, as described in paragraph (b) above, is included with the\ndistribution. This option is valid only if you are a non-commercial\nparty, and only if you received the Object Form of the Work along with\nsuch an offer.\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Work either gratis or for a fee, and\nif desired, you may offer warranty protection for the Work.\n\nThe aggregation of the Work with other works that are not based on the\nWork -- such as but not limited to inclusion in a publication,\nbroadcast, compilation, or other media -- does not bring the other\nworks in the scope of the License; nor does such aggregation void the\nterms of the License for the Work.\n\n4. MODIFICATION.\n\nPermission is granted to modify or sample from a copy of the Work,\nproducing a derivative work, and to distribute the derivative work\nunder the terms described in the section for distribution above,\nprovided that the following terms are met:\n\n(a) The new, derivative work is published under the terms of this License.\n\n(b) The derivative work is given a new name, so that its name or title\n    cannot be confused with the Work, or with a version of the Work,\n    in any way.\n\n(c) Appropriate authorship credit is given: for the differences\n    between the Work and the new derivative work, authorship is\n    attributed to you, while the material sampled or used from the\n    Work remains attributed to the original Author; appropriate notice\n    must be included with the new work indicating the nature and the\n    dates of any modifications of the Work made by you.\n\n5. NO RESTRICTIONS.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the Work or any of its\nderivative works beyond those restrictions described in this License.\n\n6. ACCEPTANCE.\n\nCopying, distributing or modifying the Work (including but not limited\nto sampling from the Work in a new work) indicates acceptance of these\nterms. If you do not follow the terms of this License, any rights\ngranted to you by the License are null and void. The copying,\ndistribution or modification of the Work outside of the terms\ndescribed in this License is expressly prohibited by law.\n\nIf for any reason, conditions are imposed on you that forbid you to\nfulfill the conditions of this License, you may not copy, distribute\nor modify the Work at all.\n\nIf any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law,\nthat part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with\nthe law, and no other parts of the License shall be affected.\n\n7. NO WARRANTY.\n\nTHE WORK IS PROVIDED \"AS IS,\" AND COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,\nINCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY\nOR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n8.

All rights reserved.\n\n    NOTE: This License is not the same as any of the GNU Licenses\n    published by the Free Software Foundation. Its terms are\n    substantially different from those of the GNU Licenses. If you are\n    familiar with the GNU Licenses, please read this license with\n    extra care.\n\nAladdin Enterprises hereby grants to anyone the permission to apply\nthis License to their own work, as long as the entire License\n(including the above notices and this paragraph) is copied with no\nchanges, additions, or deletions except for changing the first\nparagraph of Section 0 to include a suitable description of the work\nto which the license is being applied and of the person or entity that\nholds the copyright in the work, and, if the License is being applied\nto a work created in a country other than the United States, replacing\nthe first paragraph of Section 6 with an appropriate reference to the\nlaws of the appropriate country.\n\nThis License is not an Open Source license: among other things, it\nplaces restrictions on distribution of the Program, specifically\nincluding sale of the Program. While Aladdin Enterprises respects and\nsupports the philosophy of the Open Source Definition, and shares the\ndesire of the GNU project to keep licensed software freely\nredistributable in both source and object form, we feel that Open\nSource licenses unfairly prevent developers of useful software from\nbeing compensated proportionately when others profit financially from\ntheir work. This License attempts to ensure that those who receive,\nredistribute, and contribute to the licensed Program according to the\nOpen Source and Free Software philosophies have the right to do so,\nwhile retaining for the developer(s) of the Program the power to make\nthose who use the Program to enhance the value of commercial products\npay for the privilege of doing so.  0. Subject Matter This License\napplies to the computer programs known as \"AFPL Ghostscript\", \"AFPL\nGhostscript PCL5e\", \"AFPL Ghostscript PCL5c\", and \"AFPL Ghostscript\nPXL\".  The \"Program\", below, refers to such program. The Program is a\ncopyrighted work whose copyright is held by Artifex Software Inc.,\nlocated in San Rafael California and artofcode LLC, located in\nBenicia, California (the \"Licensor\"). Please note that AFPL\nGhostscript is neither the program known as \"GNU Ghostscript\" nor the\nversion of Ghostscript available for commercial licensing from Artifex\nSoftware Inc.\n\nA \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\nderivative work of the Program, as defined in the United States\nCopyright Act of 1976, such as a translation or a modification.\n\nBY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE\nPROGRAM), YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND\nALL ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING\nTHE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE\nGRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS\nDERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT\nACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE\nPROGRAM.\n\n1. Licenses.\n\nLicensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you\ncomply with all of the restrictions set forth in this License and\nprovided, further, that you distribute an unmodified copy of this\nLicense with the Program:\n\n(a) You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the\n    Program's source code as you receive it throughout the world, in\n    any medium.\n\n(b) You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program and\n    distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any medium.\n\n2. Restrictions.\n\nThis license is subject to the following restrictions:\n\n(a) Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by a\n    commercial organization to any third party is prohibited if any\n    payment is made in connection with such distribution, whether\n    directly (as in payment for a copy of the Program) or indirectly\n    (as in payment for some service related to the Program, or payment\n    for some product or service that includes a copy of the Program\n    \"without charge\"; these are only examples, and not an exhaustive\n    enumeration of prohibited activities). The following methods of\n    distribution involving payment shall not in and of themselves be a\n    violation of this restriction:\n\n    (i) Posting the Program on a public access information storage and\n        retrieval service for which a fee is received for retrieving\n        information (such as an on-line service), provided that the\n        fee is not content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same\n        for retrieving the same volume of information consisting of\n        random data) and that access to the service and to the Program\n        is available independent of any other product or service. An\n        example of a service that does not fall under this section is\n        an on-line service that is operated by a company and that is\n        only available to customers of that company. (This is not an\n        exhaustive enumeration.)\n\n   (ii) Distributing the Program on removable computer-readable media,\n        provided that the files containing the Program are reproduced\n        entirely and verbatim on such media, that all information on\n        such media be redistributable for non-commercial purposes\n        without charge, and that such media are distributed by\n        themselves (except for accompanying documentation) independent\n        of any other product or service. Examples of such media\n        include CD-ROM, magnetic tape, and optical storage\n        media. (This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.) An\n        example of a distribution that does not fall under this\n        section is a CD-ROM included in a book or magazine. (This is\n        not an exhaustive enumeration.)\n\n(b) Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of\n    the Program are not subject to this License and they are outside\n    its scope. Functional use (running) of the Program is not\n    restricted, and any output produced through the use of the Program\n    is subject to this license only if its contents constitute a work\n    based on the Program (independent of having been made by running\n    the Program).\n\n(c) You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to any\n    work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part\n    contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof (\"the\n    Work\"):\n\n    (i) If you have modified the Program, you must cause the Work to\n        carry prominent notices stating that you have modified the\n        Program's files and the date of any change. In each source\n        file that you have modified, you must include a prominent\n        notice that you have modified the file, including your name,\n        your e-mail address (if any), and the date and purpose of the\n        change;\n\n   (ii) You must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at no\n        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License;\n\n  (iii) If the Work normally reads commands interactively when run,\n        you must cause it, at each time the Work commences operation,\n        to print or display an announcement including an appropriate\n        copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n        else, saying that you provide a warranty). Such notice must\n        also state that users may redistribute the Work only under the\n        conditions of this License and tell the user how to view the\n        copy of this License included with the Work. (Exceptions: if\n        the Program is interactive but normally prints or displays\n        such an announcement only at the request of a user, such as in\n        an \"About box\", the Work is required to print or display the\n        notice only under the same circumstances; if the Program\n        itself is interactive but does not normally print such an\n        announcement, the Work is not required to print an\n        announcement.);\n\n   (iv) You must accompany the Work with the complete corresponding\n        machine-readable source code, delivered on a medium\n        customarily used for software interchange. The source code for\n        a work means the preferred form of the work for making\n        modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source\n        code means all the source code for all modules it contains,\n        plus any associated interface definition files, plus the\n        scripts used to control compilation and installation of the\n        executable code. If you distribute with the Work any component\n        that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)\n        with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n        operating system on which the executable runs, you must also\n        distribute the source code of that component if you have it\n        and are allowed to do so;\n\n    (v) If you distribute any written or printed material at all with\n        the Work, such material must include either a written copy of\n        this License, or a prominent written indication that the Work\n        is covered by this License and written instructions for\n        printing and/or displaying the copy of the License on the\n        distribution medium;\n\n   (vi) You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient's\n        exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the\nequivalent ability to copy from a designated place, then offering\nequivalent ability to copy the source code from the same place counts\nas distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source code along with the object code.\n\n3. Reservation of Rights.\n\nNo rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth\nherein. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the\nProgram except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\nLicense. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from\nyou under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long\nas such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n4. Other Restrictions.\n\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical\ndistribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n5. Limitations.\n\nTHE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU \"AS IS,\" WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY\nRIGHTS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nPROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR\nLOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM\nTO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\nPARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n6. General.\n\nThis License is governed by the laws of the State of California,\nU.S.A., excluding choice of law rules.\n\nIf any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law,\nthat part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with\nthe law, and no other parts of the License shall be affected.\n\nFor United States Government users, the Program is provided with\nRESTRICTED RIGHTS. If you are a unit or agency of the United States\nGovernment or are acquiring the Program for any such unit or agency,\nthe following apply:\n\n    If the unit or agency is the Department of Defense (\"DOD\"), the\n    Program and its documentation are classified as \"commercial\n    computer software\" and \"commercial computer software\n    documentation\" respectively and, pursuant to DFAR Section\n    227.7202, the Government is acquiring the Program and its\n    documentation in accordance with the terms of this License. If the\n    unit or agency is other than DOD, the Program and its\n    documentation are classified as \"commercial computer software\" and\n    \"commercial computer software documentation\" respectively and,\n    pursuant to FAR Section 12.212, the Government is acquiring the\n    Program and its documentation in accordance with the terms of this\n    License.\n",

This license may be particularly\nsuitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but \nit is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is \nunrelated to TeX.\n\nThe section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',\nbelow, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors\nwho are considering distributing their works under this license.\n\nThis license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed\nand modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of\nthat work may be distributed.\n\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you\nthe freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work\nthat conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while\nmaintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of\nthat work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while\nmeeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'\nand `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n===========\n\nIn this license document the following terms are used:\n\n   `Work'\n    Any work being distributed under this License.\n    \n   `Derived Work'\n    Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.\n\n   `Modification' \n    Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable\n    law -- for example, the production of a file containing an\n    original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of\n    such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\n    translated into another language.\n\n   `Modify'\n    To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any\n    applicable law.\n    \n   `Distribution'\n    Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in\n    whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)\n    making any electronic components of the Work accessible by\n    file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file\n    systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).\n\n   `Compiled Work'\n    A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it\n    is directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may\n    include using installation facilities provided by the Work,\n    transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or\n    other activities.  Note that modification of any installation\n    facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.\n\n   `Current Maintainer'\n    A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is\n    no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under\n    any applicable law.\n\n   `Base Interpreter' \n    A program or process that is normally needed for running or\n    interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.    \n\n    A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these\n    are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each\n    external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used\n    interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the\n    license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a\n    `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the \n    `LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'.\n\n\n\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n===========================================\n\n1.  Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work\nare not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In\nparticular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no\nrequirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.\n\n2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you\nreceived it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered\nmodification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived\nWork may be assumed under the terms of this clause.\n\n3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a\ncomplete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2\nabove, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that\nthe recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly\nas it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work\ndirectly from the Work.\n\n4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without\nrestriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may\nalso distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including\nCompiled Works generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works\ndistributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to\nbe updated versions of the Work.\n\n5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify\nyour copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,\nand compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on\nthe Derived Work.\n\n6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\ndistribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met\nfor every component of the Work unless that component clearly states\nin the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition.  Only\nthe Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption \nto a component of the Work. \n\n  a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement\n     for a component of the Work when that component is used with the\n     Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work\n     identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that\n     Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work\n     clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version\n     of this component to the user when used interactively with that\n     Base Interpreter.\n     \n  b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices\n     detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a\n     prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part\n     of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log\n     of the changes.\n  \n  c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,\n     including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version\n     of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)\n     the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the\n     Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that\n     they do provide such support for the Derived Work.\n\n  d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:\n\n       1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; \n          if your distribution of a modified component is made by\n          offering access to copy the modified component from a\n          designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\n          the Work from the same or some similar place meets this\n          condition, even though third parties are not compelled to\n          copy the Work along with the modified component;\n\n       2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,\n          unmodified copy of the Work.\n\n7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\ndistribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as\nthe Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled\nWork, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with\nregard to the Derived Work.\n\n8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not\napply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it\nbecomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as\nit is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.\n\n9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative\nformat, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is\nthen produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or\nnullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of\napplying that process.\n     \n10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license\n       provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in\n       Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have\n       to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.\n      \n    b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that\n       Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of\n       itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the \n       restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.\n\n11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to\nthe Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating\nsuch works with the Work by any means.\n\n12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent\ncomplete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.\n\n\nNO WARRANTY\n===========\n\nThere is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in\nwriting, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without\nwarranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not\nlimited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a\nparticular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance\nof the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you assume\nthe cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\n\nIn no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing\nwill The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the\nWork, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as\npermitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general,\nspecial, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of\nthe Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited\nto, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by\nanyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other\nprograms), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other\nparty has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n\nMAINTENANCE OF THE WORK\n=======================\n\nThe Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder\nexplicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in\nthe Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder\nor simply that it is `author-maintained'.\n\nThe Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer\nwho has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error\nreports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail\naddress). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge\nor act upon these error reports.\n\nThe Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there\nis no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current\nMaintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means\nof communication for a period of six months, and there are no other\nsignificant signs of active maintenance.\n\nYou can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with\nany existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.\n\nIf the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of\nthe Work through the following steps:\n\n 1.  Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and\n     the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of\n     an Internet or similar search.\n\n 2.  If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work\n     is still maintained.\n\n  a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer\n     to update their communication data within one month.\n     \n  b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active\n     maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce\n     within the pertinent community your intention to take over\n     maintenance.  (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be\n     done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)\n\n 3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass\n     maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect\n     immediately upon announcement.\n     \n  b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright\n     Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you,\n     then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.  \n    \n 4.  If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above\n     and after three months your intention is challenged neither by\n     the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other\n     people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as\n     to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.\n     \n 5.  If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes\n     reachable once more within three months of a change completed\n     under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must\n     become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided\n     they then update their communication data within one month.\n\nA change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact\nthat the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.\n\nIf you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should\nimmediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous\nstatement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You should also\nannounce your new status to the same pertinent community as\nin 2b) above.\n\n\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE\n======================================================\n\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and\nrecommendations for authors who are considering distributing their\nworks under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in\nthis section.\n\nChoosing This License or Another License\n----------------------------------------\n\nIf for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*\nconditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then\ndo not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,\ndistribute your work under a different license.  You may use the text\nof this license as a model for your own license, but your license\nshould not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that\nyour work is distributed under the LPPL.\n\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains\nthe motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,\nfor example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public\nLicense (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your work is\nunrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be\nrelevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any\nlicense are encouraged to read it.\n\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own\npersonal use, without also meeting the above conditions for\ndistributing the modified component.  While you might intend that such\nmodifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by\naccident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or\nit may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified\nversion that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions\nof this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,\ncause problems for the community.  It is therefore usually in your\nbest interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public\none.  Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work\nwithout altering any of its licensed components.\n\nHow to Use This License\n-----------------------\n\nTo use this license, place in each of the components of your work both\nan explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work\nwas authored and/or last substantially modified.  Include also a\nstatement that the distribution and/or modification of that\ncomponent is constrained by the conditions in this license.\n\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\n\n  %% pig.dtx\n  %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name\n  %\n  % This work may be distributed and/or modified under the\n  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3\n  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\n  % The latest version of this license is in\n  %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt\n  % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX\n  % version 2005/12/01 or later.\n  %\n  % This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.\n  % \n  % The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.\n  %\n  % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\n  % and the derived file pig.sty.\n\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions\ngiven in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring\nto the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being\ngenerated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'\nreferring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and\n`Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.\n\nIf you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your\nWork, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'.  \nHowever, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance\nsection was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to\nthe community even when you can no longer maintain and support it\nyourself.\n\nDerived Works That Are Not Replacements\n---------------------------------------\n\nSeveral clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and\nstability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves\nwith the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a\n(compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If\nthis is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a\ncompletely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.\n\n\nImportant Recommendations\n-------------------------\n\n Defining What Constitutes the Work\n\n   The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the\n   files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a\n   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.\n   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the\n   files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by\n   using a line such as:\n\n    % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\n   \n   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be\n   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you\n   to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be\n   entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise\n   the Work.\n",

LICENSE GRANT\n\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby\ngrants You a worldwide, royaltyfree, nonexclusive, perpetual (for the\nduration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in\nthe Work as stated below:\n\n    a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\nCollections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n\n    b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such\nAdaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable\nsteps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes\nwere made to the original Work. For example, a transla tion could be\nmarked The original work was translated from English to Spanish, or a\nmodification could indicate The original work has been modified.;\n\n    c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as\nincorporated in Collections; and,\n\n    d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by\nLicensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights\nset forth in Section 4(f).\n\n 4. RESTRICTIONS\n\nThe license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and\nlimited by the following restrictions:\n\n    a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the\nterms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform\nResource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work\nYou Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any\nterms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability\nof the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that\nrecipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the\nWork. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to\nthe disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute\nor Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work,\nYou may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that\nrestrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the\nrights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This\nSection 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but\nthis does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be\nmade subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,\nupon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,\nremove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as\nrequested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor\nYou must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any\ncredit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.\n\n    b. Subject to the exception in Section 4(c), you may not exercise\nany of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that\nis primarily intended for or directed to ward commercial advantage or\nprivate monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other\ncopyrighted works by means of digital filesharing or otherwise shall not\nbe considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage\nor private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any\nmonetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\n\nc. *You may exercise the rights granted in Section 3 for commercial\npurposes only if:*\n\n    i. *You are a workerowned business or workerowned collective; and*\n    ii. *all financial gain, surplus, profits and benefits produced by\nthe business or collective are distributed among the workerowners*\n\n      d. Any use by a business that is privately owned and managed, and\nthat seeks to generate profit from the labor of employees paid by salary\nor other wages, is not permitted under this license.\n\n    e. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any\nAdaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made\npursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copy right notices for the\nWork and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing:\n(i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if\nsupplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate\nanother party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity,\njournal) for attribution (Attribution Parties) in Licensors copyright\nnotice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such\nparty or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the\nextent reason ably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies\nto be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the\ncopyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv)\nconsistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit\nidentifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., French\ntranslation of the Work by Original Author, or Screenplay based on\noriginal Work by Original Author). The credit required by this Section\n4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,\nthat in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit\nwill appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation\nor Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at\nleast as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this\nSection for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,\nby exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or\nexplicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or\nendorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,\nas appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,\nexpress prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or\nAttribution Parties.\n\n    f. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n        i. Nonwaivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those\njurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any\nstatutory or compulsory licensing scheme can not be waived, the Licensor\nreserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise\nby You of the rights granted under this License;\n\n        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions\nin which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\ncompulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the\nexclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the\nrights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for\na purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted\nunder Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties\nthrough any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,\n        iii.Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right\nto collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the\nLicensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary\nlicensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the\nrights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is\notherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b).\n\n    g. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may\nbe otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute\nor Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\nAdaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or\ntake other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be\nprejudicial to the Original Authors honor or reputation. Licensor\nagrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise\nof the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make\nAdaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,\nmodification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original\nAuthors honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as\nappropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\napplicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right\nunder Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not\notherwise.\n\n 5. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMER\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\nOFFERS THE WORK ASIS AND MAKES NO REP RESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\nKIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\nINCLUD ING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTI BILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\nLATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,\nWHETHER OR NOT DIS COVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\nEXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT AP PLY TO YOU.\n\n 6. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL\nLICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,\nINCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF\nTHIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED\nOF THE POS SIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n7. TERMINATION\n\n    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\nautomatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\nIndividuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\nfrom You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\nterminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\ncompliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\nsurvive any termination of this License.\n\n    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted\nhere is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the\nWork). Notwithstanding the above, Li censor reserves the right to\nrelease the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing\nthe Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not\nserve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or\nis required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\nLicense will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\nstated above.\n\n 8. MISCELLANEOUS\n\n    a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a\nCollection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work\non the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under\nthis License.\n\n    b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,\nLicensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the\nsame terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable\nunder applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability\nof the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further\naction by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be\nreformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid\nand enforceable.\n\n    d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and\nno breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\nand signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n\n    e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\nwith respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\nagreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\nhere. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may\nappear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified\nwithout the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n    f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in\nthis License were draft ed utilizing the terminology of the Berne\nConvention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended\non September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\nTreaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and\nthe Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These\nrights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in\nwhich the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the\ncorresponding provisions of the implemen tation of those treaty\nprovisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of\nrights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights\nnot granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be\nincluded in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the\nlicense of any rights under applicable law.\n",

If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\n     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\n     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)\n     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\n     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\n     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\n     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to\n     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\n     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\n     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\n     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\n     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\n     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\n     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\n     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\n     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\n     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\n     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\n     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\n     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\n     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\n     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\n     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\n     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\n     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\n     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\n     terms You offer.\n\n     3.7. Larger Works.\n     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\n     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\n     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\n     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\n     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\n     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\n     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\n     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n     understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\n     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n     6.1. New Versions.\n     Netscape Communications Corporation (\"Netscape\") may publish revised\n     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version\n     will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n     6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the\n     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\n     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\n     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one\n     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to\n     Covered Code created under this License.\n\n     6.3. Derivative Works.\n     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\n     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\n     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\n     the phrases \"Mozilla\", \"MOZILLAPL\", \"MOZPL\", \"Netscape\",\n     \"MPL\", \"NPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your\n     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)\n     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license\n     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and\n     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial\n     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in\n     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of\n     this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\n     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\n     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\n     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\n     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\n     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\n     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\n     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\n     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\n     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\n     shall survive.\n\n     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\n     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\n     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\n     You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\")  alleging that:\n\n     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\n     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\n     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\n     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\n     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\n     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\n     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\n     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\n     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\n     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\n     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\n     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\n     the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\n     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\n     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\n     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\n     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\n     Participant.\n\n     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\n     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\n     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n     license.\n\n     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\n     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\n     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\n     prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\n     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\n     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\n     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\n     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\n     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\n     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\n     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\n     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n     The Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in\n     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\n     software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such\n     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\n     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\n     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\n     rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\n     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if\n     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.\n     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,\n     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United\n     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be\n     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern\n     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\n     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\n     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and\n     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\n     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\n     License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\n     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n\n     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n     \"Multiple-Licensed\".  \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial\n     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\n     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified\n     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\n\nEXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.\n\n     ``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License\n     Version 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in\n     compliance with the License.

By contrast, our General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The\nGeneral Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's\nsoftware and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.\nYou can use it for your programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make\nsure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free\nsoftware, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\nthat you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free\nprograms; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must tell them their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be\ndistributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The\n\"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\non the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each\nlicensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\nGeneral Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\nother recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License\nalong with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of\ntransferring a copy.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\nit, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph\n1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\n    you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n\n    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that\n    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either\n    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all\n    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except\n    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all\n    third parties, at your option).\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\n    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use\n    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General\n    Public License.\n\n    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\n    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in\n    exchange for a fee.\n\nMere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its\nderivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\nthe other work under the scope of these terms.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of\nit, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nParagraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge\n    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\n    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the\n    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\nSource code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special\nexception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard\nlibraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable\nfile runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that\naccompany that operating system.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the\nProgram except as expressly provided under this General Public License.\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer\nthe Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use\nthe Program under this License.  However, parties who have received\ncopies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties\nremain in full compliance.\n\n  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based\non the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,\nand all its terms and conditions.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original\nlicensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\nterms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the\nrecipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthe license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\nterms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to\nattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\nthe exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)\n    any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston MA  02110-1301 USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\nappropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the\ncommands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show\nc'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your\nprogram.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes\n  at assemblers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n",

Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code or\n        previous Modifications.\n\n1.10. \"Original Code\" means Source Code of computer software code\n      which is described in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit\n      A as Original Code, and which, at the time of its release under\n      this License is not already Covered Code governed by this\n      License.\n\n1.10.1. \"Patent Claims\" means any patent claim(s), now owned or\n        hereafter acquired, including without limitation, method,\n        process, and apparatus claims, in any patent Licensable by\n        grantor.\n\n1.11. \"Source Code\" means the preferred form of the Covered Code for\n      making modifications to it, including all modules it contains,\n      plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to\n      control compilation and installation of an Executable, or source\n      code differential comparisons against either the Original Code\n      or another well known, available Covered Code of the\n      Contributor's choice. The Source Code can be in a compressed or\n      archival form, provided the appropriate decompression or\n      de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.\n\n1.12. \"You\" (or \"Your\") means an individual or a legal entity\n      exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of,\n      this License or a future version of this License issued under\n      Section 6.1. For legal entities, \"You\" includes any entity which\n      controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with\n      You. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (a) the\n      power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management\n      of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b)\n      ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding\n      shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\n2.

Distribution Obligations.\n\n3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to\n     which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License,\n     including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version\n     of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this\n     License or a future version of this License released under\n     Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with\n     every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer\n     or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or\n     restricts the applicable version of this License or the\n     recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an\n     additional document offering the additional rights described in\n     Section 3.5.\n\n3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or\n     to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code\n     form under the terms of this License either on the same media as\n     an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution\n     Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version\n     available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution\n     Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months\n     after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)\n     months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\n     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible\n     for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even\n     if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third\n     party.\n\n3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to\n     which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes\n     You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any\n     change. You must include a prominent statement that the\n     Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\n     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of\n     the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any\n     notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which\n     You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n\n     (a) Third Party Claims.\n\n         If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third\n         party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise\n         the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or\n         2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source\n         Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim\n         and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a\n         recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains\n         such knowledge after the Modification is made available as\n         described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify\n         the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available\n         thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying\n         appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably\n         calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that\n         new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n    (b) Contributor APIs.  \n\n        If Contributor's Modifications include an application\n        programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent\n        licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,\n        Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL\n        file.\n\n    (c) Representations.\n\n        Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\n        Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\n        Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\n        Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed\n        by this License.  \n\ntrend\n<http://trenduhren.de/>\n\n3.5. Required Notices.\n\n     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the\n     Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a\n     particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must\n     include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)\n     where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You\n     created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a\n     Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also\n     duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code\n     where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights\n     relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge\n     a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations\n     to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so\n     only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\n     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear\n     than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n     obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to\n     indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n     liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor\n     as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms\n     You offer.\n\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered\n     Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code\n     version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this\n     License, including a description of how and where You have\n     fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be\n     conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,\n     related documentation or collateral in which You describe\n     recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may\n     distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership\n     rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms\n     different from this License, provided that You are in compliance\n     with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the\n     recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\n     forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version\n     under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that\n     any terms which differ from this License are offered by You\n     alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You\n     hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\n     Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer\n     or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n3.7. Larger Works.\n\n     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other\n     code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the\n     Larger Work as a single LEDs product. In such a case, You must\n     make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the\n     Covered Code. 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or\n     Regulation.\n\n     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of\n     this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due\n     to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a)\n     comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent\n     possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they\n     affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file\n     described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all\n     distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited\n     by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently\n     detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n     understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\n   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n   attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n6.1. New Versions.\n\n     Netizen Pty Ltd (\"Netizen \") may publish revised and/or new\n     versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be\n     given a distinguishing version number.\n\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version\n     of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms\n     of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code\n     under the terms of any subsequent version of the License\n     published by Netizen. No one other than Netizen has the right to\n     modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this\n     License.\n\n6.3. Derivative Works.\n\n     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which\n     you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already\n     Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your\n     license so that the phrases \"Netizen\", \"NOSL\" or any confusingly\n     similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that\n     your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it\n     clear that Your version of the license contains terms which\n     differ from the Netizen Open Source License and Xen Open Source\n     License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original\n     Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall\n     not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS\n   FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\n   NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE\n   OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE\n   DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY\n   OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,\n   REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN\n   ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS\n   AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n7.1 To the extent permitted by law and except as expressly provided to\n    the contrary in this Agreement, all warranties whether express,\n    implied, statutory or otherwise, relating in any way to the\n    subject matter of this Agreement or to this Agreement generally,\n    are excluded. Where legislation implies in this Agreement any\n    condition or warranty and that legislation avoids or prohibits\n    provisions in a contract excluding or modifying the application of\n    or the exercise of or liability under such term, such term shall\n    be deemed to be included in this Agreement. However, the liability\n    of Supplier for any breach of such term shall be limited, at the\n    option of Supplier, to any one or more of the following: if the\n    breach related to goods: the replacement of the goods or the\n    supply of equivalent goods; the repair of such goods; the payment\n    of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent\n    goods; or the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired;\n    and if the breach relates to services the supplying of the\n    services again; or the payment of the cost of having the services\n    supplied again.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to\n     cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the\n     breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly\n     granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions\n     which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the\n     termination of this License shall survive.\n\n8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\n     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial\n     Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor\n     against whom You file such action is referred to as\n     \"Participant\") alleging that:\n\n     (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n         infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\n         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this\n         License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate\n         prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of\n         notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a\n         mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and\n         future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii)\n         withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the\n         Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60\n         days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement\n         are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the\n         litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by\n         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2\n         automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day\n         notice period specified above.\n\n     (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such\n         Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly\n         infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such\n         Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked\n         effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,\n         distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\n         Participant.\n\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\n     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved\n     (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of\n     patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the\n     licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2\n     shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of\n     any payment or license.\n\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all\n     end user license agreements (excluding distributors and\n     resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any\n     distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive\n     termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n   (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n   INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n   COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO\n   ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n   DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR\n   LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION,\n   OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH\n   PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n   DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY\n   FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE\n   TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME\n   JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF\n   INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND\n   LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n    The Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined\n    in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\n    software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as\n    such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent\n    with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4\n    (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code\n    with only those rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n    necessary to make it enforceable.  This Agreement shall be\n    governed by and construed according to the law of the State of\n    Victoria. The parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive\n    jurisdiction of the Courts of Victoria and Australia and any\n    Courts hearing appeals from such Courts. This Agreement is deemed\n    to have been made in Victoria.  The application of the United\n    Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of\n    Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides\n    that the language of a contract shall be construed against the\n    drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or\n    indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License\n    and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to\n    distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing\n    herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission\n    of liability.\n\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n\n    Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n    \"Multiple-Licensed\". \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial\n    Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code\n    under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any,\n    specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in\n    Exhibit A.\n\nEXHIBIT A - Netizen Open Source License\n\n``The contents of this file are subject to the Netizen Open Source\nLicense Version 1.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except\nin compliance with the License.

Last change: 2008 Jun 21\n\n\n\t\t  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar\n\n\n\n\t\t\t*uganda* *Uganda* *copying* *copyright* *license*\nSUMMARY\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t*iccf* *ICCF*\nVim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are\nencouraged to make a donation for needy children in Uganda.  Please see |kcc|\nbelow or visit the ICCF web site, available at these URLs:\n\n\thttp://iccf-holland.org/\n\thttp://www.vim.org/iccf/\n\thttp://www.iccf.nl/\n\nYou can also sponsor the development of Vim.  Vim sponsors can vote for\nfeatures.  See |sponsor|.  The money goes to Uganda anyway.\n\nThe Open Publication License applies to the Vim documentation, see\n|manual-copyright|.\n\n\nVIM LICENSE\n\nI)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except\n    that they must include this license text.  You can also distribute\n    unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must\n    include this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables\n    that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage\n    examples and Vim scripts.\n\nII) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,\n    including executables and/or source code, when the following four\n    conditions are met:\n    1) This license text must be included unmodified.\n    2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:\n       a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in\n\t  the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you\n\t  (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you\n\t  must make your changes, including source code, available to the\n\t  maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to\n\t  include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the\n\t  maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they\n\t  will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation\n\t  then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.\n\tThe current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>. If this \n\t  changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely\n\t  vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When it is completely\n\t  impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him\n\t  your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has\n\t  received your changes they will not have to be sent again.\n       b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as\n\t  mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it\n\t  unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the\n\t  text under a) applies to those changes.\n       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of\n\t  the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of a\n\t  context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you\n\t  add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from\n\t  making their own changes to the official version of Vim.\n       d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned\n\t  under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the\n\t  changes if the following three conditions are met:\n\t  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute\n\t    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and\n\t    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official\n\t    version of Vim without fee or restriction.\n\t  - You keep the changes for at least three years after last\n\t    distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer\n\t    or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in\n\t    any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them\n\t    available to him.\n\t  - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This\n\t    contact information must remain valid for at least three years\n\t    after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long\n\t    as possible.\n       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,\n\t  you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or\n\t  any later version.\n    3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the \":version\"\n       command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim\n       is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned\n       under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does\n       not conflict with the license used for the changes.\n    4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be\n       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make\n       corrections.\n\nIII) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use\n     the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the\n     maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is\n     by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.\n     If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a\n     context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is\n<maintainer@vim.org> \n\nIV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim\n     sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this\n     license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came\n     with, at your option.\n\n\nNote:\n\n- If you are happy with Vim, please express that by reading the rest of this\n  file and consider helping needy children in Uganda.\n\n- If you want to support further Vim development consider becoming a\n  |sponsor|.  The money goes to Uganda anyway.\n\n- According to Richard Stallman the Vim license is GNU GPL compatible.\n  A few minor changes have been made since he checked it, but that should not\n  make a difference.\n\n- If you link Vim with a library that goes under the GNU GPL, this limits\n  further distribution to the GNU GPL.  Also when you didn't actually change\n  anything in Vim.\n\n- Once a change is included that goes under the GNU GPL, this forces all\n  further changes to also be made under the GNU GPL or a compatible license.\n\n- If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you can include your name and\n  contact information with the \"--with-modified-by\" configure argument or the\n  MODIFIED_BY define.\n\n==============================================================================\n\nKibaale Children's Centre\t\t*kcc* *Kibaale*  *charity*\n\nKibaale Children's Centre (KCC) is located in Kibaale, a small town in the\nsouth of Uganda, near Tanzania, in East Africa.  The area is known as Rakai\nDistrict.  The population is mostly farmers.  Although people are poor, there\nis enough food.  But this district is suffering from AIDS more than any other\npart of the world.  Some say that it started there.  Estimations are that 10\nto 30% of the Ugandans are infected with HIV.  Because parents die, there are\nmany orphans.  In this district about 60,000 children have lost one or both\nparents, out of a population of 350,000.  And this is still continuing.\n\nThe children need a lot of help.  The KCC is working hard to provide the needy\nwith food, medical care and education.  Food and medical care to keep them\nhealthy now, and education so that they can take care of themselves in the\nfuture.  KCC works on a Christian base, but help is given to children of any\nreligion.\n\nThe key to solving the problems in this area is education.  This has been\nneglected in the past years with president Idi Amin and the following civil\nwars.  Now that the government is stable again, the children and parents have\nto learn how to take care of themselves and how to avoid infections.  There is\nalso help for people who are ill and hungry, but the primary goal is to\nprevent people from getting ill and to teach them how to grow healthy food.\n\nMost of the orphans are living in an extended family.  An uncle or older\nsister is taking care of them.  Because these families are big and the income\n(if any) is low, a child is lucky if it gets healthy food.  Clothes, medical\ncare and schooling is beyond its reach.  To help these needy children, a\nsponsorship program was put into place.  A child can be financially adopted.\nFor a few dollars a month KCC sees to it that the child gets indispensable\nitems, is healthy, goes to school and KCC takes care of anything else that\nneeds to be done for the child and the family that supports it.\n\nBesides helping the child directly, the environment where the child grows up\nneeds to be improved.  KCC helps schools to improve their teaching methods.\nThere is a demonstration school at the centre and teacher trainings are given.\nHealth workers are being trained, hygiene education is carried out and\nhouseholds are stimulated to build a proper latrine.  I helped setting up a\nproduction site for cement slabs.  These are used to build a good latrine.\nThey are sold below cost price.\n\nThere is a small clinic at the project, which provides children and their\nfamily with medical help.  When needed, transport to a hospital is offered.\nImmunization programs are carried out and help is provided when an epidemic is\nbreaking out (measles and cholera have been a problem).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t*donate*\nSummer 1994 to summer 1995 I spent a whole year at the centre, working as a\nvolunteer.  I have helped to expand the centre and worked in the area of water\nand sanitation.  I learned that the help that the KCC provides really helps.\nWhen I came back to Holland, I wanted to continue supporting KCC.  To do this\nI'm raising funds and organizing the sponsorship program.  Please consider one\nof these possibilities:\n\n1.  Sponsor a child in primary school: 17 euro a month (or more).\n2.  Sponsor a child in secondary school: 25 euro a month (or more).\n3.  Sponsor the clinic: Any amount a month or quarter\n4.  A one-time donation\n\nCompared with other organizations that do child sponsorship the amounts are\nvery low.  This is because the money goes directly to the centre.  Less than\n5% is used for administration.  This is possible because this is a small\norganization that works with volunteers.  If you would like to sponsor a\nchild, you should have the intention to do this for at least one year.\n\nHow do you know that the money will be spent right?  First of all you have my\npersonal guarantee as the author of Vim.  I trust the people that are working\nat the centre, I know them personally.  Further more, the centre is\nco-sponsored and inspected by World Vision, Save the Children Fund and\nInternational Child Care Fund.  The centre is visited about once a year to\ncheck the progress (at our own cost).  I have visited the centre myself in\n1996, 1998, 2000, 2001 and 2003.  The visit reports are on the ICCF web site.\n\nIf you have any further questions, send me e-mail: <Bram@vim.org>. \n\nThe address of the centre is:\n\t\t\tKibaale Children's Centre\n\t\t\tp.o. box 1658\n\t\t\tMasaka, Uganda, East Africa\n\n\nSending money:\t\t\t\t\t\t*iccf-donations*\n\nCheck the ICCF web site for the latest information!

By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\nspecific requirements.\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n",

  "Affero_General_Public_License": " AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 1, March 2002\n\nCopyright Â© 2002 Affero Inc.\n510 Third Street - Suite 225, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA\n\nThis license is a modified version of the GNU General Public License copyright\n(C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. made with their permission.\nSection 2(d) has been added to cover use of software over a computer network.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\ndocument, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\nand change it. By contrast, the Affero General Public License is intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users. This Public License applies to most of\nAffero's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.\n(Some other Affero software is covered by the GNU Library General Public\nLicense instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. This\nGeneral Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\ndistribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\nthe software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\ncan do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\nyou these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for\na fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make\nsure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them\nthese terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\noffer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the\nsoftware is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\nknow that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\nby others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish\nto avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually\nobtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent\nthis, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\nfree use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Affero General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such\nprogram or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or\nany derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\ntranslated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\nlimitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not\nrestricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\nrunning the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\nand to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\nProgram a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\nat your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\n    * a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    * b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that\n    in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    * c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\n    * d) If the Program as you received it is intended to interact\n    with users through a computer network and if, in the version you\n    received, any user interacting with the Program was given the\n    opportunity to request transmission to that user of the Program's\n    complete source code, you must not remove that facility from your\n    modified version of the Program or work based on the Program, and\n    must offer an equivalent opportunity for all users interacting\n    with your Program through a computer network to request immediate\n    transmission by HTTP of the complete source code of your modified\n    version or other derivative work.\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\nworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\nof this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\nwhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\nthe Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\nSection 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\n2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    * A) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\n    interchange; or,\n\n    * b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    * c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the\n    offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative\n    is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the\nsource code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\nof the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\nneed not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\nbinary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\naccompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\ncode from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\nthird parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\nor its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\naccept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or\nany work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\ndo so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\ncopy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\nrights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\nthird parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\nare imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\ncontradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\nconditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\nof the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\nyou, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\nthe section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\ndistribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\nchoice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\ncopyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such\ncase, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of\nthis License.\n\n9. Affero Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the Affero General\nPublic License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit\nto the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or\nconcerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\na version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\",\nyou have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that\nversion or of any later version published by Affero, Inc. If the Program does\nnot specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever\npublished by Affero, Inc.\n\nYou may also choose to redistribute modified versions of this program under any\nversion of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License version 3\nor higher, so long as that version of the GNU GPL includes terms and conditions\nsubstantially equivalent to those of this license.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\npermission. For software which is copyrighted by Affero, Inc., write to us; we\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\ngoals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\nTHE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

  "GPLv3orlater_with_exception": " GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n",

  "Python2.0.1": " Python 2.0.1 license\n\nThis is the official license for the Python 2.0.1 release:\n\nA. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor of a\nlanguage called ABC.  Guido is Python's principal author, although it\nincludes many contributions from others.  The last version released\nfrom CWI was Python 1.2.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python\nat the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston,\nVirginia where he released several versions of the software.  Python\n1.6 was the last of the versions released by CNRI.  In 2000, Guido and\nthe Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the\nBeOpen PythonLabs team.  Python 2.0 was the first and only release\nfrom BeOpen.com.\n\nFollowing the release of Python 1.6, and after Guido van Rossum left\nCNRI to work with commercial software developers, it became clear that\nthe ability to use Python with software available under the GNU Public\nLicense (GPL) was very desirable.  CNRI and the Free Software\nFoundation (FSF) interacted to develop enabling wording changes to the\nPython license.  Python 1.6.1 is essentially the same as Python 1.6,\nwith a few minor bug fixes, and with a different license that enables\nlater versions to be GPL-compatible.  Python 2.0.1 is a derivative work\nof Python 1.6.1, as well as of Python 2.0.\n\nAfter Python 2.0 was released by BeOpen.com, Guido van Rossum and the\nother PythonLabs developers joined Digital Creations.  All\nintellectual property added from this point on, including Python\n2.0.1 and its alpha and beta releases, is owned by the Python Software\nFoundation (PSF), a non-profit modeled after the Apache Software\nFoundation.  See http://www.python.org/psf/ for more information about\nthe PSF.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

  "AGPLv1orlater": " AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 1, March 2002\n\nCopyright Â© 2002 Affero Inc.\n510 Third Street - Suite 225, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA\n\nThis license is a modified version of the GNU General Public License copyright\n(C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. made with their permission.\nSection 2(d) has been added to cover use of software over a computer network.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\ndocument, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\nand change it. By contrast, the Affero General Public License is intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users. This Public License applies to most of\nAffero's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.\n(Some other Affero software is covered by the GNU Library General Public\nLicense instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. This\nGeneral Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\ndistribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\nthe software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\ncan do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\nyou these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for\na fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make\nsure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them\nthese terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\noffer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the\nsoftware is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\nknow that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\nby others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish\nto avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually\nobtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent\nthis, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\nfree use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Affero General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such\nprogram or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or\nany derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\ntranslated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\nlimitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not\nrestricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\nrunning the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\nand to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\nProgram a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\nat your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\n    * a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    * b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that\n    in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    * c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\n    * d) If the Program as you received it is intended to interact\n    with users through a computer network and if, in the version you\n    received, any user interacting with the Program was given the\n    opportunity to request transmission to that user of the Program's\n    complete source code, you must not remove that facility from your\n    modified version of the Program or work based on the Program, and\n    must offer an equivalent opportunity for all users interacting\n    with your Program through a computer network to request immediate\n    transmission by HTTP of the complete source code of your modified\n    version or other derivative work.\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\nworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\nof this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\nwhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\nthe Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\nSection 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\n2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    * A) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\n    interchange; or,\n\n    * b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    * c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the\n    offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative\n    is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the\nsource code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\nof the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\nneed not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\nbinary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\naccompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\ncode from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\nthird parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\nor its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\naccept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or\nany work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\ndo so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\ncopy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\nrights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\nthird parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\nare imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\ncontradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\nconditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\nof the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\nyou, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\nthe section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\ndistribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\nchoice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\ncopyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such\ncase, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of\nthis License.\n\n9. Affero Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the Affero General\nPublic License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit\nto the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or\nconcerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\na version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\",\nyou have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that\nversion or of any later version published by Affero, Inc. If the Program does\nnot specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever\npublished by Affero, Inc.\n\nYou may also choose to redistribute modified versions of this program under any\nversion of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License version 3\nor higher, so long as that version of the GNU GPL includes terms and conditions\nsubstantially equivalent to those of this license.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\npermission. For software which is copyrighted by Affero, Inc., write to us; we\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\ngoals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\nTHE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\nSTATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\nPROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU\nASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nPROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\nINABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\nBEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\nOR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n",

Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file\n        containing Original Code or previous Modifications.\n\n        B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code or\n        previous Modifications.\n         \n    1.10. ''Original Code'' means Source Code of computer software\n    code which is described in the Source Code notice required by\n    Exhibit A as Original Code, and which, at the time of its release\n    under this License is not already Covered Code governed by this\n    License.\n\n    1.10.1. \"Patent Claims\" means any patent claim(s), now owned or\n    hereafter acquired, including without limitation, method, process,\n    and apparatus claims, in any patent Licensable by grantor.\n\n    1.11. ''Source Code'' means the preferred form of the Covered Code\n    for making modifications to it, including all modules it contains,\n    plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to\n    control compilation and installation of an Executable, or source\n    code differential comparisons against either the Original Code or\n    another well known, available Covered Code of the Contributor's\n    choice. The Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form,\n    provided the appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is\n    widely available for no charge.\n\n    1.12. \"You'' (or \"Your\") means an individual or a legal entity\n    exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of,\n    this License or a future version of this License issued under\n    Section 6.1. For legal entities, \"You'' includes any entity which\n    controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with\n    You. For purposes of this definition, \"control'' means (a) the\n    power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of\n    such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of\n    more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares or\n    beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\n2. Source Code License.\n\n    2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.\n\n    The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide,\n    royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party\n    intellectual property claims:\n\n        (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\n        trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,\n        modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the\n        Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without\n        Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\n\n        (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or\n        selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,\n        sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the\n        Original Code (or portions thereof).\n\n        (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are\n        effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes\n        Original Code under the terms of this License.\n\n        (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is\n        granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code;\n        2) separate from the Original Code; or 3) for infringements\n        caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the\n        combination of the Original Code with other software or\n        devices.\n         \n    2.2. Contributor Grant.\n\n    Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each\n    Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\n    non-exclusive license\n         \n        (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\n        trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce,\n        modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the\n        Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions\n        thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other\n        Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger\n        Work; and\n\n        (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or\n        selling of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone\n        and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or\n        portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for\n        sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications\n        made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the\n        combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its\n        Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).\n\n        (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are\n        effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use\n        of the Covered Code.\n\n        (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is\n        granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the\n        Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version;\n        3) for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications\n        of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of Modifications\n        made by that Contributor with other software (except as part\n        of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under\n        Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of\n        Modifications made by that Contributor.\n\n\n3. Distribution Obligations.\n\n    3.1. Application of License.\n\n    The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\n    governed by the terms of this License, including without\n    limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code\n    may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a\n    future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You\n    must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source\n    Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any\n    Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable\n    version of this License or the recipients' rights\n    hereunder. However, You may include an additional document\n    offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\n\n    3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n\n    Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must\n    be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this\n    License either on the same media as an Executable version or via\n    an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom\n    you made an Executable version available; and if made available\n    via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for\n    at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became\n    available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version\n    of that particular Modification has been made available to such\n    recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code\n    version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution\n    Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n    3.3. Description of Modifications.\n\n    You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain\n    a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered\n    Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent\n    statement that the Modification is derived, directly or\n    indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer\n    and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source\n    Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related\n    documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the\n    Covered Code.\n\n    3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n\n        (a) Third Party Claims.\n\n        If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third\n        party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise\n        the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or\n        2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\n        distribution titled \"LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the\n        party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient\n        will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such\n        knowledge after the Modification is made available as\n        described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify\n        the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available\n        thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying\n        appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated\n        to inform those who received the Covered Code that new\n        knowledge has been obtained.\n\n        (b) Contributor APIs.\n\n        If Contributor's Modifications include an application\n        programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent\n        licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,\n        Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL\n        file.\n         \n        (c)    Representations.\n\n        Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\n        Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\n        Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\n        Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed\n        by this License.\n\n\n    3.5. Required Notices.\n\n    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the\n    Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a\n    particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must\n    include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)\n    where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You\n    created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a\n    Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also\n    duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code\n    where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating\n    to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee\n    for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one\n    or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on\n    Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\n    Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such\n    warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by\n    You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer\n    and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\n    Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n    indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n    3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n    requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered\n    Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code\n    version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this\n    License, including a description of how and where You have\n    fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be\n    conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,\n    related documentation or collateral in which You describe\n    recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may\n    distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership\n    rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms\n    different from this License, provided that You are in compliance\n    with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n    Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the\n    recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\n    forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version\n    under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that\n    any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,\n    not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree\n    to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as\n    a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n    3.7. Larger Works.\n\n    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other\n    code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the\n    Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make\n    sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the\n    Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of\n    this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due\n    to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a)\n    comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent\n    possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they\n    affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file\n    described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all\n    distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited\n    by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently\n    detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n    understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\n    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n    attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n    6.1. New Versions.\n\n    Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish\n    revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each\n    version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n    6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\n    the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of\n    that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under\n    the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by\n    Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the\n    terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n\n    6.3. Derivative Works.\n\n    If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you\n    may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already\n    Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your\n    license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'',\n    ''Netscape'', \"MPL\", ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do\n    not appear in your license (except to note that your license\n    differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that\n    Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the\n    Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in\n    the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in\n    the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be\n    deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS'' BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS\n    FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\n    NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE\n    OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE\n    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY\n    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,\n    REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN\n    ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS\n    AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n    8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to\n    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the\n    breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly\n    granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions\n    which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the\n    termination of this License shall survive.\n\n    8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent\n    infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against\n    Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or\n    Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as\n    \"Participant\") alleging that:\n\n    (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\n    Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\n    shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate\n    prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice\n    You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually\n    agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of\n    Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your\n    litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against\n    such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable\n    royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in\n    writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,\n    the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or\n    2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice\n    period specified above.\n\n    (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such\n    Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly\n    infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such\n    Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective\n    as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had\n    made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n\n    8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against\n    Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version\n    directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is\n    resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the\n    initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable\n    value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections\n    2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount\n    or value of any payment or license.\n\n    8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\n    all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and\n    resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any\n    distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive\n    termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n    COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO\n    ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n    DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES\n    FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR\n    MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,\n    EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\n    SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO\n    LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S\n    NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH\n    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR\n    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS\n    EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n    The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined\n    in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial\n    computer software'' and ''commercial computer software\n    documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212\n    (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48\n    C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all\n    U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\n    rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed\n    by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law,\n    if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law\n    provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party\n    is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do\n    business in the United States of America, any litigation relating\n    to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the\n    Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue\n    lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party\n    responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs\n    and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of\n    the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\n    Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which\n    provides that the language of a contract shall be construed\n    against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or\n    indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License\n    and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to\n    distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing\n    herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission\n    of liability.\n\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n\n    Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n    ï¿½Multiple-Licensedï¿½.  ï¿½Multiple-Licensedï¿½ means that the Initial\n    Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code\n    under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any,\n    specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in\n    Exhibit A.\n\n\nEXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.\n\n    ``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public\n    License Version 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file\n    except in compliance with the License.

  "AGPLv3_with_exception": " GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 19 November 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure\ncooperation with the community in the case of network server software.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\nspecific requirements.\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n",
  "HESSLA": " TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, USE AND/OR MODIFICATION\n\n0. DEFINITIONS. The following are defined terms that, whenever used in\nthis License Agreement, have the following meanings:\n\n0.1 Author: \"Author\" shall mean the copyright holder of an Original\nWork (the \"Program\") released by the Author under this License\nAgreement.\n\n0.2 Copy: \"Copy\" shall mean everything and anything that constitutes a\ncopy according to copyright law, without limitation. A \"copy\" does not\nbecome anything other than a \"copy\" merely because, for example, a\ngovernmental or institutional employee duplicates the Program or a\npart of it for another employee of the same institution or\nGovernmental Entity, or merely because it is copied from one computer\nto another, or from one medium to another, or multiple copies are made\non the same medium, within the same institutional or Governmental\nEntity.\n\n0.3 Derivative Work: A \"Derivative Work\" or \"work based on the\nProgram\" shall mean either the Program itself or any work containing\nthe Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\nand/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification.\"). In the\nunlikely event that, and to the extent that, this contractual\ndefinition of \"Derivative Work\" is later determined by any tribunal or\ndispute-resolution body to be different is scope from the meaning of\n\"derivative work\" under the copyright law of any country, then the\nbroadest and most encompassing possible definition either the\ncontractual definition of \"Derivative Work,\" or any broader and more\nencompassing statutory or legal definition, shall control. Acceptance\nof this contractually-defined scope of the term \"Derivative Work\" is a\nmandatory pre-condition for You to receive any of the benefits offered\nby this License Agreement.\n\n0.3.1 Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with\nthe Program (or with a Derivative Work based on the Program) on a\nvolume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other\nwork under the scope of this License Agreement.\n\n0.4 License Agreement: When used in this License Agreement, the terms\n\"this License\" or \"this License Agreement\" shall mean The Hactivismo\nEnhanced-Source Software License Agreement, v. 0.1, or any subsequent\nversion made applicable under the terms of Section 15.\n\n0.5 Licensee: The term \"Licensee\" shall mean You or any other\nLicensee, whether or not a Qualified Licensee.\n\n0.6 Original Work: \"Original Work\" shall mean a Program or other work\nof authorship, or portion thereof, that is not a Derivative Work.\n\n0.7 Program: The \"Program,\" to which this License Agreement applies,\nis the Original Work (including, but not limited to, computer\nsoftware) released by the Author under this License Agreement.\n\n0.8 Qualified Licensee: A \"Qualified Licensee\" means a Licensee that\nremains in full compliance with all terms and conditions of this\nLicense Agreement. You are no longer a Qualified Licensee if, at any\ntime, You violate any terms of this License Agreement. Neither the\nProgram nor any Software based on the Program may be copied,\ndistributed, performed, displayed, used or modified by You, even for\nYour own purposes, unless You are a Qualified Licensee. A Licensee\nother than a Qualified Licensee remains subject to all terms and\nconditions of this License Agreement, and to all remedies for each\ncumulative violation as set forth herein. Loss of the status of\nQualified Licensee signifies that violation of any terms of the\nLicense Agreement subjects a Licensee to loss of most of the benefits\nthat Qualified Licensees enjoy under this License Agreement, and to\nadditional remedies for all violations occurring after the first\nviolation.\n\n0.9 Software: \"Software\" or \"the Software\" shall mean the Program, any\nDerivative Work based on the Program or a portion thereof, and/or any\nmodified version of the Program or portion thereof, without\nlimitation.\n\n0.10 Source Code: The term \"Source Code\" shall mean the preferred form\nof a Program or Original Work for making modifications to it and all\navailable documentation describing how to access and modify that\nProgram or Original Work.\n\n0.10.1 For an executable work, complete Source Code means all the\nSource Code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and\ninstallation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the\nSource Code distributed need not include anything that is normally\ndistributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n0.10.2 \"Object Code:\" Because of certain peculiarities of current\nexport-control rules, \"object code\" of the Program, or any modified\nversion of the Program, or Derivative Work based on the Program, must\nnot be exported except by way of distribution that is ancillary to the\ndistribution of the Source Code. The \"Source Code\" shall be understood\nas the primary content transferred or exported by You, and the \"object\ncode\" shall be considered as merely an ancillary component of any such\nexport distribution.\n\n0.11 Strong Cryptography: \"Strong Cryptography\" shall mean\ncryptography no less secure than (for example, and without limitation)\na 2048-bit minimum key size for RSA encryption, 1024-bit minimum key\nsize for Diffie-Hellman (El Gamal), or a 256-bit minimum key size for\nAES and similar symmetric ciphers.\n\n0.12 Substandard Key-Selection Technique: The term \"Substandard\nKey-Selection Technique\" shall mean a method or technique to cause\nencryption keys to be more easily guessed or less secure, such as by\n(i) causing the selection of keys to be less than random, or (ii)\nemploying a selection process that selects among only a subset of\npossible keys, instead of from among the largest set of possible keys\nthat can securely be used consistent with contemporary knowledge about\nthe cryptographic techniques employed by You. The following\nillustrations elaborate on the foregoing definition:\n\n0.12.1 If the key-generation or key-selection technique for the\nencryption algorithm You employ involves the selection of one or more\nprime numbers, or involves one or more mathematical functions or\nconcatenations performed on one or more prime numbers, then each prime\nnumber should be selected from a very large set of candidate prime\nnumbers, but not necessarily from the set of all possible prime\nnumbers (e.g., inclusion of the number 1 in the candidate set, for\nexample, may in some instances reduce rather than enhance security),\nand absolutely not from any artificially small set of candidate primes\nthat makes the guessing of a key easier than would be the case if a\nsecure key-generation technique were employed. In all instances, the\nprimes should be selected at random from among the candidate set. If\nthere is a customary industry standard for maximizing the security\nassociated with the key-generation or key-selection technique for the\ncryptosystem You select, then (with attention also to the requirements\nof Section 0.11), You should employ a key-generation or selection\ntechnique no less secure than the customary industry standard for\nsecure use of the cryptosystem.\n\n0.12.2 If the key-generation or key-selection technique for the\nencryption algorithm You employ involves the selection of a random\ninteger, or the transformation of a random integer through one or more\nmathematical processes, then the selection of the integer shall be at\nrandom from the largest possible set of all possible integers\nconsistent with the secure functioning of the encryption algorithm. It\nshall not be selected from an artificially small set of integers\n(e.g., if a 256-bit random integer serves as the key, then You could\nnot set 200 of the 256 bits as \"0,\" and randomly generate only the\nremaining 56 bits producing effectively a 56-bit keylength instead of\nusing the full 256 bits).\n\n0.12.3 In other words, Your key-generation technique must promote\nsecurity to the maximum extent permitted by the cryptographic\nmethod(s) and keylength You elect to employ, rather than facilitating\neavesdropping or surveillance in any way. The example of GSM\ntelephones, in which 16 of 56 bits in each encryption key were set at\n\"0,\" thereby reducing the security of the system by a factor of\n65,536, is particularly salient. Such artificial techniques to reduce\nthe security of a cryptosystem by selecting keys from only a\nless-secure or suboptimal subset of possible keys, is prohibited and\nwill violate this License Agreement if any such technique is employed\nin any Software.\n\n0.13 You: Each Licensee (including, without limitation, Licensees that\nhave violated the License Agreement and who are no longer Qualified\nLicensees, but who nevertheless remain subject to all requirements of\nthis License Agreement and to all cumulative remedies for each\nsuccessive violation), is referred to as \"You.\"\n\n0.13.1 Governmental Entity: \"You\" explicitly includes any and all\n\"Governmental Entities,\" without limitation. \"Governmental Entity\" or\n\"Governmental Entities,\" when used in this License Agreement, shall\nmean national governments, sub-national governments (for example, and\nwithout limitation, provincial, state, regional, local and municipal\ngovernments, autonomous governing units, special districts, and other\nsuch entities), governmental subunits (without limitation,\ngovernmental agencies, offices, departments, government corporations,\nand the like), supra-national governmental entities such as the\nEuropean Union, and entities through which one or more governments\nperform governmental functions or exercise governmental power in\ncoordination, cooperation or unison.\n\n0.13.2 Governmental Person: \"You\" also explicitly includes\n\"Governmental Persons.\" The terms \"Governmental Person\" or\n\"Governmental Persons,\" when used in this License Agreement, shall\nmean the officials, officers, employees, representatives, contractors\nand agents of any Governmental Entity.\n\n1. Application of License Agreement. This License Agreement applies to\nany Program or other Original Work of authorship that contains a\nnotice placed by the Author saying it may be distributed under the\nterms of this License Agreement. The preferred manner of placing such\na notice is to include the following statement immediately after the\ncopyright notice for such an Original Work:\n\n    \"Licensed under the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License\n    Agreement, Version 0.1\"\n\n2. Means of Acceptance Use, Copying, Distribution or Modification By\nAnyone Constitutes Acceptance. Subject to Section 14.1 (concerning the\nspecial case of certain Governmental Entities) any copying,\nmodification, distribution, or use by You of the Program or any\nSoftware, shall constitute Your acceptance of all terms and conditions\nof this License Agreement.\n\n2.1 As a Licensee, You may not authorize, permit, or enable any person\nto use the Program or any Software or Derivative Work based on it\n(including any use of Your copy or copies of the Program) unless such\nperson has accepted this License Agreement and has become a Licensee\nsubject to all its terms and conditions.\n\n2.2 You may not make any copy for Your own use unless You have\naccepted this License Agreement and subjected yourself to all its\nterms and conditions.\n\n2.3 You may not make a copy for the use of any other person, or\ntransfer a copy to any other person, unless such person is a Licensee\nthat has accepted this License Agreement and such person is subject to\nall terms and conditions of this License Agreement.\n\n2.4 It is not the position of Hacktivismo that copyright law confers\nan exclusive right to use, as opposed to the exclusive right to copy\nthe Software. However, for purposes of contract law, any use of the\nSoftware shall be considered to constitute acceptance of this License\nAgreement. Moreover, all copying is prohibited unless the recipient of\na copy has accepted the License Agreement. Because each such recipient\nLicensee is contractually obligated not to permit anyone to access,\nuse, or secure a copy of the Software, without first accepting the\nterms and conditions of this License Agreement, use by non-Licensees\nis effectively prohibited contractually because nobody can obtain a\ncopy of, or access to a copy of, any Software without (1) accepting\nthe License Agreement through use, and (2) triggering some Licensee's\nobligation to require acceptance as a precondition of copying or\naccess.\n\n3. \"Qualified Licensee\" Requirement: Neither the Program nor any\nSoftware or Derivative Work based on the Program may be copied,\ndistributed, displayed, performed, used or modified by You, even for\nYour own purposes, unless You are a \"Qualified Licensee.\" To remain a\nQualified Licensee, You must remain in full compliance with all terms\nand conditions of this License Agreement.\n\n4. License Agreement Is Exclusive Source of All Your Rights:\n\n4.1 You may not copy, modify, or distribute the Program, or obtain any\ncopy, except as expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, obtain a copy, sublicense or\ndistribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate Your\nrights under this License Agreement and subject You to all cumulative\nremedies for each successive violation that may be available to the\nAuthor. However, Qualified Licensees who have received copies from You\n(and thereby have received rights from the Author) under this License\nAgreement, and who would otherwise qualify as Qualified Licensees,\nwill not have their rights under their License Agreements suspended or\nrestricted on account of anything You do, so long as such parties\nremain in full compliance.\n\n4.2 You are not required to accept this License Agreement and prior to\nthe time You elect to become a Licensee and accept this License\nAgreement, You may always elect instead not to copy, use, modify,\ndistribute, compile, or perform the Program or any Software released\nunder this License Agreement. However, nothing else grants You\npermission to copy, to obtain or possess a copy, to compile a copy in\nobject code or executable code from a copy in source code, to modify,\nor to distribute the Program or any Software based on the\nProgram. These actions are prohibited by law if You do not accept this\nLicense Agreement. Additionally, as set forth in Section 2, any use,\ncopying or modification of the Software constitutes acceptance of this\nLicense Agreement by You.\n\n4.3 Each time You redistribute the Program (or any Software or\nDerivative Work based on the Program), the recipient automatically\nreceives a License Agreement from the Author to copy, distribute,\nmodify, perform or display the Software, subject to the terms and\nconditions of this License Agreement. You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\nherein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\nparties to this License Agreement. Enforcement is the responsibility\nof the Author.\n\n5. Grant of Source Code License.\n\n5.1 Source Code Always Available from Author: Author hereby promises\nand agrees except to the extent prohibited by export-control law to\nprovide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Program at\nthe request of any Licensee. Author reserves the right to satisfy this\nobligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of\nthe most current version of the Program in an information repository\nreasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by\nYou for so long as Author continues to distribute the Program, and by\npublishing the address of that information repository in a notice\nimmediately following the copyright notice that applies to the\nProgram. Every copy of the Program distributed by Hacktivismo (but not\nnecessarily every other Author) consists of the Source Code\naccompanied, in some instances, by an ancillary distribution of\ncompiled Object Code, but the continued availability of the Source\nCode from the Author addresses the possibility that You might have\n(for any reason) not received from someone else a complete, current,\ncopy of the Source Code (lack of which would, for example, prevent You\nfrom exporting copies to others without violating this license, see\nSection 8).\n\n5.2 Grant of License. If and only if, and for so long as You remain a\nQualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this License\nAgreement, Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\nnon-exclusive, non-sublicensable copyright license to do the\nfollowing:\n\n5.2.1 to reproduce the Source Code of the Program in copies;\n\n5.2.2 to prepare Derivative Works based upon the Program and to edit\nor modify the Source Code in the process of preparing such Derivative\nWorks;\n\n5.2.3 to distribute copies of the Source Code of the Original Work\nand/or of Derivative Works to others, with the proviso that copies of\nOriginal Work or Derivative Works that You distribute shall be\nlicensed under this License Agreement, and that You shall fully inform\nall recipients of the terms of this License Agreement.\n\n6. Grant of Copyright License. If and only if, and for so long as You\nremain a Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this\nLicense Agreement, Author hereby grants You a world-wide,\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to do the\nfollowing:\n\n6.1 to reproduce the Program in copies;\n\n6.2 to prepare Derivative Works based upon the Program, or upon\nSoftware that itself is based on the Program;\n\n6.3 to distribute (either by distributing the Source Code, or by\ndistributing compiled Object Code, but any export of Object Code must\nbe ancillary to a distribution of Source Code) copies of the Program\nand Derivative Works to others, with the proviso that copies of the\nProgram or Derivative Works that You distribute shall be licensed\nunder this License Agreement, that You shall fully inform all\nrecipients of the terms of this License Agreement;\n\n6.4 to perform the Program or a Derivative Work publicly;\n\n6.5 to display the Program or a Derivative Work publicly; and\n\n6.6 to charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy of the\nProgram (You may also, at Your option, offer warranty protection in\nexchange for a fee).\n\n7. Grant of Patent License. If and only if, and for so long as You\nremain a Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this\nLicense Agreement, Author hereby grants You a world-wide,\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license Agreement,\nunder patent claims owned or controlled by the Author that are\nembodied in the Program as furnished by the Author (\"Licensed Claims\")\nto make, use, sell and offer for sale the Program. Subject to the\nproviso that You grant all Licensees a world-wide, non-exclusive,\nroyalty-free license under any patent claims embodied in any\nDerivative Work furnished by You, Author hereby grants You a\nworld-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license\nunder the Licensed Claims to make, use, sell and offer for sale\nDerivative Works.\n\n8. Exclusions From License Agreement Grants. Nothing in this License\nAgreement shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks,\ncopyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property\nof Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is\ngranted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent\nclaims other than the Licensed Claims defined in Section 7. No right\nis granted to the trademarks of Author even if such marks are included\nin the Program. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be interpreted\nto prohibit Author from licensing under additional or different terms\nfrom this License Agreement any Original Work, Program, or Derivative\nWork that Author otherwise would have a right to License.\n\n8.1 Implied Endorsements Prohibited. Neither the name of the Author\n(in the case of Programs and Original Works released by Hacktivismo,\nthe name \"Hacktivismo\"), nor the names of contributors who helped\nproduce the Program may be used to endorse or promote modifications of\nthe Program, any Derivative Work, or any Software other than the\nProgram, without specific prior written permission of the\nAuthor. Neither the name of Hacktivismo nor the names of any\ncontributors who helped write the Program may be used to endorse or\npromote any Program or Software released under this License Agreement\nby any person other than Hacktivismo.\n\n9. Modifications and Derivative Works. Only Qualified Licensees may\nmodify the Software or prepare or distribute Derivative Works. If You\nare a Qualified Licensee, Your authorization to modify the Software or\nprepare or distribute Derivative Works (including permission to\nprepare and/or distribute Derivative Works, as provided in Sections\n5.2.2, 5.2.3, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.6) is subject to each and all of the\nfollowing mandatory terms and conditions (9.1 through 9.6, inclusive):\n\n9.1 You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that You changed the files and the date of any change;\n\n9.2 If the modified Software normally reads commands interactively\nwhen run, You must cause it, when started running for such interactive\nuse in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement\nincluding an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is\nno warranty (or else, saying that You provide a warranty) and that\nusers may redistribute the program under this License Agreement, and\ntelling the user how to view a copy of this License\nAgreement. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\nnot normally print such an announcement, Your Derivative Work based on\nthe Program is not required to print an announcement.);\n\n9.3 Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or\ndistributed by You, that incorporates any portion of the Original\nWork, must not contain any code or functionality that subverts the\nsecurity of the Software or the end-user's expectations of privacy,\nanonymity, confidentiality, authenticity, and trust, including\n(without limitation) any code or functionality that introduces any\n\"backdoor,\" escrow mechanism, \"spy-ware,\" or surveillance techniques\nor methods into any such Program, Software, or modification thereof;\n\n9.4 Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or\ndistributed by You, that employs any cryptographic or other security,\nprivacy, confidentiality, authenticity, and/or trust methods or\ntechniques, including without limitation any Derivative Work that\nincludes any changes or modifications to any cryptographic techniques\nin the Program, shall employ Strong Cryptography.\n\n9.5 Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or\ndistributed by You, if it contains any key-generation or selection\ntechnique, must not employ any Substandard Key-Selection Technique.\n\n9.6 No Program or Software copied or distributed by You may transmit\nor communicate any symmetric key, any \"private key\" if an asymmetric\ncryptosystem is employed, or any part of such key, nor may it\notherwise make any such key or part of such key known, to any person\nother than the end-user who generated the key, without the active\nconsent and participation of that individual end-user. If a private or\nsymmetric key is stored or recorded in any manner, it must not be\nstored or recorded in plaintext, and it must be protected from reading\n(at a minimum) by use of a password. Use of steganography or other\ntechniques to disguise the fact that a private or symmetric key is\neven stored is strongly encouraged, but not absolutely required.\n\n10. Use Restrictions: Human Rights Violations Prohibited.\n\n10.1 Neither the Program, nor any Software or Derivative Work based on\nthe Program may used by You for any of the following purposes (10.1.1\nthrough 10.1.5, inclusive):\n\n10.1.1 to violate or infringe any human rights or to deprive any\nperson of human rights, including, without limitation, rights of\nprivacy, security, collective action, expression, political freedom,\ndue process of law, and individual conscience;\n\n10.1.2 to gather evidence against any person to be used to deprive any\nperson of human rights;\n\n10.1.3 any other use as a part of any project or activity to deprive\nany person of human rights, including not only the above-listed\nrights, but also rights of physical security, liberty from physical\nrestraint or incarceration, freedom from slavery, freedom from\ntorture, freedom to take part in government, either directly or\nthrough lawfully elected representatives, and/or freedom from\nself-incrimination;\n\n10.1.4 any surveillance, espionage, or monitoring of individuals,\nwhether done by a Governmental Entity, a Governmental Person, or by\nany non-governmental person or entity;\n\n10.1.5 censorship or \"filtering\" of any published information or expression.\n\n10.2 Additionally, the Program, any modification of it, or any\nSoftware or Derivative Work based on the Program may not be used by\nany Governmental Entity or other institution that has any policy or\npractice (whether official or unofficial) of violating the human\nrights of any persons.\n\n10.3 You may not authorize, permit, or enable any person (including,\nwithout limitation, any Governmental Entity or Governmental Person) to\nuse the Program or any Software or Derivative Work based on it\n(including any use of Your copy or copies of the Program) unless such\nperson has accepted this License Agreement and has become a Licensee\nsubject to all its terms and conditions, including (without\nlimitation) the use restrictions embodied in Section 10.1 and 10.2,\ninclusive.\n\n11. All Export Distributions Must Consist of or Be Ancillary to\nDistribution of Source Code. Because of certain peculiarities of\ncurrent export-control law, any distribution by You of the Program or\nany Software may be in the form of Source Code only, or in the form or\nSource Code accompanied by compiled Object Code, but You may not\nexport any Software in the form of compiled Object Code only. Such an\nexport distribution of compiled executable code must in all cases be\nancillary to a distribution of the complete corresponding\nmachine-readable source code, which must be distributed on a medium,\nor by a method, customarily used for software interchange.\n\n12. EXPORT LAWS: THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ADDS NO RESTRICTIONS TO THE\nEXPORT LAWS OF YOUR JURISDICTION. It is Your responsibility to comply\nwith any export regulations applicable in Your jurisdiction. From the\nUnited States, Canada, or many countries in Europe, export or\ntransmission of this Software to certain embargoed destinations\n(including, but not necessarily limited to, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya,\nNorth Korea, Sudan, and Syria), may be prohibited. If Hacktivismo is\nidentified as the Author of the Program (and it is not the property of\nsome other Author), then export to any national of Cuba, Iran, Iraq,\nLibya, North Korea, Sudan or Syria, or into the territory of any of\nthese countries, by any Licensee who has received this Software\ndirectly from Hacktivismo or from the Cult of the Dead Cow, or any of\ntheir members, is contractually prohibited and will constitute a\nviolation of this License Agreement. You are advised to consult the\ncurrent laws of any and all countries whose laws may apply to You,\nbefore exporting this Software to any destination. Special care should\nbe taken to avoid export to any embargoed destination. An Author other\nthan Hacktivismo may substitute that Author's legal name for\n\"Hacktivismo\" in this Paragraph, in relation to any Program released\nby that Author under this Paragraph.\n\n13. Contrary Judgments, Settlements and Court Orders. If, as a\nconsequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement\nor for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are\nimposed on You (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\ncontradict the conditions of this License Agreement, they do not\nexcuse You from the conditions of this License Agreement. If You\ncannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously Your obligations\nunder this License Agreement and any other pertinent obligations, then\nas a consequence You may not distribute the Software at all. For\nexample, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\nredistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly\nor indirectly through You, then the only way You could satisfy both it\nand this License Agreement would be to refrain entirely from\ndistribution of the Program.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this Section 13 to induce You to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this Section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the software distribution system reflected in this\nLicense Agreement, which is implemented by public license\npractices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide\nrange of software distributed through related distribution systems, in\nreliance on consistent application of such distribution systems; it is\nup to the Author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\nsoftware through any other system and a Licensee cannot impose that\nchoice.\n\n14. Governmental Entities: Any Governmental Entity (\"Governmental\nEntity\" is defined broadly as set forth in Section 0.13.1) or\nGovernmental Person (as \"Governmental Person\" is defined broadly in\nSection 0.13.2), that uses, modifies, changes, copies, displays,\nperforms, or distributes the Program, or any Software or Derivative\nWork based on the Program, may do so if and only if all of the\nfollowing terms and conditions (14.1 through 14.10, inclusive) are\nagreed to and fully met:\n\n14.1 If it is the position of any Governmental Entity (or, in the case\nof any \"Governmental Person,\" if it is the position of that\nGovernmental Person's Governmental Entity) that any doctrine or\ndoctrines of law (including, without limitation, any doctrine(s) of\nimmunity or any formalities of contract formation) may render this\nLicense Agreement unenforceable or less than fully enforceable against\nsuch Governmental Entity, or any Governmental Person of such\nGovernmental Entity, then prior to any use, modification, change,\ndisplay, performance, copy or distribution of the Program, or of any\nSoftware or Derivative Work based on the Program, or any part thereof,\nby the Governmental Entity, or by any Governmental Person of that\nGovernmental Entity, the Governmental Entity shall be required to\ninform the Author in writing of each such doctrine that is believed to\nrender this License Agreement or any part of it less than fully\nenforceable against such Governmental Entity or any Governmental\nPerson of such entity, and to explain in reasonable detail what\nadditional steps, if taken, would render the License Agreement fully\nenforceable against such entity or person. Failure to provide the\nrequired written notice to the Author in advance of any such use,\nmodification, change, display, performance, copy or distribution,\nshall constitute an irrevocable and conclusive waiver of any and all\nreliance on any doctrine, by the Governmental Entity, that is not\nincluded or that is omitted from the required written notice (failure\nto provide any written notice means all reliance on any doctrine is\nirrevocably waived). Any Governmental Entity that provides written\nnotice under this subsection is prohibited, as are all of the\nGovernmental Persons of such Governmental Entity, from making any use,\nchange, display, performance, copy, modification or distribution of\nthe Software or any part thereof, until such time as a License\nAgreement is in place, agreed upon by the Author and by the\nGovernmental Entity, that such entity concedes is\nfully-enforceable. Any use, modification, change, display,\nperformance, copy, or distribution following written notice under this\nParagraph, but without the implementation of an agreement as provided\nherein, shall constitute an irrevocable and conclusive waiver by the\nGovernmental Entity (and any and all Governmental Persons of such\nGovernmental Entity) of any and all reliance on any legal doctrine\neither referenced in such written notice or omitted from it.\n\n14.2 Any Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies, or\ndistributes, the Software or any part or portion thereof, or any\nGovernmental Person who does so (whether that person's Governmental\nEntity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or\nofficial), permanently and irrevocably waives any defense based on\nsovereign immunity, official immunity, the Act of State Doctrine, or\nany other form of immunity, that might otherwise apply as a defense\nto, or a bar against, any legal action based on the terms of this\nLicense Agreement.\n\n14.2.1 With respect to any enforcement action brought by the Author in\na United States court against a foreign Governmental Entity, the\nwaiver by any Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1\nand 14.2 is hereby expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental\nEntity to constitute a \"case . . . in which the foreign state has\nwaived its immunity,\" within the scope of 28 U.S.C. ï¿½ 1605(a)(1) of\nthe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). Each such\nGovernmental Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the\n\"commercial activity\" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. ï¿½ 1605(a)(2),\n(3) are also applicable. With respect to an action brought against the\nUnited States or any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts\nof any country, the U.S. Governmental Entity shall be understood to\nhave voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity from\nactions in the courts of any other sovereign.\n\n14.2.2 With respect to any enforcement action brought by an authorized\nend-user (as a third-party beneficiary, under the terms of\nSubparagraphs 14.3 and 14.10) in a United States court against a\nforeign Governmental Entity, the waiver by any Governmental Entity as\nprovided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2 is hereby expressly\nacknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a \"case\n. . . in which the foreign state has waived its immunity,\" within the\nscope of 28 U.S.C. ï¿½ 1605(a)(1) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities\nAct of 1976 (as amended). .

Any person who brings\nan action under this section against any Governmental Person or Entity\nmust notify the Author promptly of the action and provide the Author\nthe opportunity to intervene to assert the Author's own\nrights. Damages in such a third-party action shall be measured by the\nseverity of the human rights violation and the copyright infringement\nor License Agreement violation, combined, and not merely by reference\nto the copyright infringement. All end-users, to the extent that they\nare entitled to bring suit against such Governmental Entity by way of\nthis License Agreement, are intended third-party beneficiaries of this\nLicense Agreement. Punitive damages may be awarded in such a\nthird-party action against a Governmental Entity or Governmental\nPerson, and each and every such Governmental Entity or Person\nconclusively waives all restrictions on the amount of punitive\ndamages, and all defenses to the award of punitive damages to the\nextend such limitations or defenses depend upon or are a function of\nsuch person or entity's status as a Governmental Person or\nGovernmental Entity.\n\n14.4 Any State of the United States, or any subunit or Governmental\nEntity thereof, that uses, copies, changes, modifies, displays,\nperforms, or distributes the Software of any part thereof, or any of\nwhose Governmental Persons does so (whether that person's Governmental\nEntity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or\nofficial), unconditionally and irrevocably waives for purposes of any\nlegal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement, (ii) to remedy\ninfringement of the Author's copyright, or (iii) to invoke any of the\nthird-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3 -- any\nimmunity under the Eleventh Amendment of the United States\nConstitution or any other immunity doctrine (such as sovereign\nimmunity or qualified, or other, official immunity) that may apply to\nstate governments, subunits, or to their Governmental Persons.\n\n14.5 Any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, any State\nof the United States), that uses, copies, changes, modifies, performs,\ndisplays, or distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any of\nwhose Governmental Persons does so (whether that person's Governmental\nEntity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or\nofficial), unconditionally and irrevocably waives for purposes of any\nlegal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement, (ii) to remedy\ninfringement of the Author's copyright, or (iii) to invoke any of the\nthird-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3 any doctrine\n(such as, but not limited to, the holding in the United States Supreme\nCourt decision of Ex Parte Young) that might purport to limit remedies\nsolely to prospective injunctive relief.

All United States Governmental Entities shall be understood\nto have agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity against (i) suit\nin the courts of other sovereigns, and (ii) execution against property\nof the United States located within the territory of other countries.\n\n14.7 Governmental Persons, (i) who violate this License Agreement\n(whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's\naction was, or was not, authorized or official), or (ii) who are\npersonally involved in any activity, policy or practice of a\ngovernmental entity that violates this License Agreement (whether that\nperson's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was\nnot, authorized or official), or (iii) that use, copy, change, modify,\nperform, display or distribute, the Software or any part thereof, when\ntheir Governmental Entity is not permitted to do so, or is not a\nQualified Licensee, or has violated the terms of this License\nAgreement, each and all individually waive and shall not be permitted\nto assert any defense of official immunity, \"good faith\" immunity,\nqualified immunity, absolute immunity, or other immunity based on his\nor her governmental status.\n\n14.8 No Governmental Entity, nor any Governmental Person thereof may,\nby legislative, regulatory, or other action, exempt such Governmental\nEntity, subunit, or person, from the terms of this License Agreement,\nif the Governmental Entity or any such person has voluntarily used,\nmodified, copied, displayed, performed, or distributed the Software or\nany part thereof.\n\n14.9 Enforcement In Courts of Other Sovereigns Permitted. By using,\nmodifying, changing, displaying, performing or distributing any\nSoftware covered by this License Agreement, any Governmental Entity\nhereby voluntarily and irrevocably consents, for purposes of (i) any\naction to enforce the terms of this License Agreement, and (ii) any\naction to enforce the Author's copyright (whether such suit be for\ninjunctive relief, damages, or both) to the jurisdiction of any court\nor tribunal in any other country (or a court of competent jurisdiction\nof a subunit, province, or state of such country) in which the terms\nof this License Agreement are believed by the Author to be\nenforceable. Each such Governmental Entity hereby waives all\nobjections to personal jurisdiction, all objections based on\ninternational comity, all objections based on the doctrine of forum\nnon conveniens, and all objections based on sovereign or governmental\nstatus or immunity that might otherwise be asserted in the courts of\nsome other sovereign.\n\n14.9.1 The Waiver by any Governmental Entity of a country other than\nthe United States shall be understood explicitly to constitute a\nwaiver for purposes of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976\n(see Subparagraphs 14.2.1to 14.2.4, inclusive, supra), and all United\nStates Governmental Entities shall be understood to have agreed to a\nwaive correspondingly broad in scope with respect to actions brought\nin the courts of other sovereigns.\n\n14.9.2 Forum Selection Non-U.S. Governmental Entities. Governmental\nEntities that are not United States Governmental Entities shall be\nsubject to suit, and agree to be subject to suit, in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia. The Author or an\nauthorized end-user may bring an action in another court in another\ncountry, but the United States District Court for the District of\nColumbia, shall always be available as an agreed-upon forum for such\nan action. At the optional election of any Author (or, in the case of\na third-party claim, any end-user asserting rights under Subparagraphs\n14.3 and 14.10), such a suit against a non-U.S. Governmental Entity or\nPerson may be brought in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York, or the United States District Court for\nthe Northern District of California, as a direct substitute for the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia, for all\npurposes of this Subparagraph.\n\n14.9.3 Forum Selection U.S. Governmental Entities. All United States\nGovernmental Entities shall be subject to suit, and agree to be\nsubject to suit, in the following (non-exclusive) list of fora:\nOttawa, Canada, London, England, and Paris, France. The Author or an\nauthorized end-user may bring action in another court that can\nexercise jurisdiction. But the courts in these three locations shall\nalways be available (at the option of the Author or an authorized\nend-user) as a forum for resolving any dispute with the United States\nor a governmental subunit thereof. Except as provided in Subparagraph\n14.10, any and all United States Governmental Persons shall be subject\nto suit wherever applicable rules of personal jurisdiction and venue\nshall permit such suit to be filed, but no such United States\nGovernmental Person may assert any defense based on forum non\nconveniens or international comity, to the selection of any particular\nlawful venue.\n\n14.10 Enforcement Of Claims For Human Rights Violations. By using,\ncopying, modifying, changing, performing, displaying or distributing\nthe Software covered by this License Agreement, any Governmental\nEntity, or Governmental Person hereby voluntarily and irrevocably\nconsents -- for purposes of any third-party action to remedy human\nrights violations and other violations of this License Agreement (as\nreflected in Section 14.3) -- to the jurisdiction of any court or\ntribunal in any other country (or a court of competent jurisdiction of\na subunit, province, or state of such country) in which the\nthird-party beneficiary reasonably believes the relevant terms of this\nLicense Agreement are enforceable. The Governmental Entity or Person\nhereby waives all objections to personal jurisdiction, all objections\nbased on international comity, all objections based on the doctrine of\nforum non conveniens, and all objections based on sovereign or\ngovernmental status or immunity that might otherwise be asserted in\nthe courts of some other sovereign.\n\n14.10.1 Waiver of Immunity and Forum Selection. The presumptively\nvalid and preferred fora identified in Subparagraphs 14.9.2 and 14.9.3\nshall also apply for purposes of Subparagraph 14.10.

If the Program released by\nanother Author, specifies only a version number, then that version\nnumber only shall apply. If \"the latest version,\" is specified, then\nthe latest version of the HESSLA published on the Hacktivismo Website\nshall always apply at all times.\n\n16. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

  "GFDLv1.2": " GNU Free Documentation License\n                  Version 1.2, November 2002\n\n\n Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\n0. PREAMBLE\n\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\nfunctional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to\nassure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,\nwith or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.\nSecondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\nto get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible\nfor modifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative\nworks of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\nlicense designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\ndistributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\nwork under the conditions stated herein.  The \"Document\", below,\nrefers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a\nlicensee, and is addressed as \"you\".  You accept the license if you\ncopy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission\nunder copyright law.\n\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\nmodifications and/or translated into another language.\n\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\nthe Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject\n(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\nwithin that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a\ntextbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\nmathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\nthem.\n\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.  If a\nsection does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not\nallowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero\nInvariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant\nSections then there are none.\n\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed,\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may\nbe at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the\ngeneral public, that is suitable for revising the document\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\nfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\nto text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\nformat whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\nor discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\nAn image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount\nof text.  A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\nor XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\nHTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of\ntransparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats\ninclude proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by\nproprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or\nprocessing tools are not generally available, and the\nmachine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word\nprocessors for output purposes only.\n\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\nplus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\nthis License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\nformats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\npreceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose\ntitle either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\ntext that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\nspecific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\",\n\"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".)  To \"Preserve the Title\"\nof such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\nsection \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\n\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\nstates that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty\nDisclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this\nLicense, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\nimplication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has\nno effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\nconditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\nyou may publicly display copies.\n\n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\nprinted covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\nDocument's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the\ncopies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\nthe back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\nyou as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\nthe full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\nvisible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\nthe title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\nas verbatim copying in other respects.\n\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\npages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\na computer-network location from which the general network-using\npublic has access to download using public-standard network protocols\na complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.\nIf you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,\nwhen you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure\nthat this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\nlocation until at least one year after the last time you distribute an\nOpaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that\nedition to the public.\n\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\nthem a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\nthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\nthe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\nVersion filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\nand modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\nof it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\n   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\n   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\n   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\n   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\n   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\n   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),\n   unless they release you from this requirement.\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\n   Modified Version, as the publisher.\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\n   adjacent to the other copyright notices.\nF. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\n   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\n   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\n   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\nI. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add\n   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\n   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\n   there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one\n   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\n   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\n   Version as stated in the previous sentence.\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\n   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\n   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\n   it was based on.  These may be placed in the \"History\" section.\n   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\n   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\n   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\nK. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\",\n   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all\n   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\n   and/or dedications given therein.\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\n   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\n   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\nM. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\".  Such a section\n   may not be included in the Modified Version.\nN. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\"\n   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\nappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\ncopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\nof these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\nlist of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\nThese titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\nnothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\nparties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\nbeen approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\nstandard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\npassage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\nof Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\nFront-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\nthrough arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\nincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\nby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\nyou may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\npermission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\ngive permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\nInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\nlicense notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by\nadding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\nauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\nMake the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\nInvariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\"\nin the various original documents, forming one section Entitled\n\"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\nand any sections Entitled \"Dedications\".  You must delete all sections\nEntitled \"Endorsements\".\n\n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\nreleased under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\nLicense in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\nthe collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\nverbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\nit individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\nLicense into the extracted document, and follow this License in all\nother respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n\n\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\nand independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright\nresulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights\nof the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.\nWhen the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not\napply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\nderivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\nthe entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\ncovers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\nOtherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole\naggregate.\n\n\n8. TRANSLATION\n\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\ndistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\nReplacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\npermission from their copyright holders, but you may include\ntranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\noriginal versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\ntranslation of this License, and all the license notices in the\nDocument, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\nthe original English version of this License and the original versions\nof those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between\nthe translation and the original version of this License or a notice\nor disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\n\"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\nits Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual\ntitle.\n\n\n9. TERMINATION\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except\nas expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to\ncopy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,\nparties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions\nof the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\nIf the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this\nLicense \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that specified version or\nof any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\nFree Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\nas a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\nthe License in the document and put the following copyright and\nlicense notices just after the title page:\n\n    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\n    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\n    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2\n    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\n    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\n    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU\n    Free Documentation License\".\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\nreplace the \"with...Texts.\" line with this:\n\n    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\n    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other\ncombination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the\nsituation.\n\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\nrecommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of\nfree software license, such as the GNU General Public License,\nto permit their use in free software.\n",
  "GFDLv1.3": " GNU Free Documentation License\n                 Version 1.3, 3 November 2008\n\n\n Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n     <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n0. PREAMBLE\n\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\nfunctional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to\nassure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,\nwith or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.\nSecondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\nto get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible\nfor modifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative\nworks of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\nlicense designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\ndistributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\nwork under the conditions stated herein.  The \"Document\", below,\nrefers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a\nlicensee, and is addressed as \"you\".  You accept the license if you\ncopy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission\nunder copyright law.\n\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\nmodifications and/or translated into another language.\n\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\nthe Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall\nsubject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall\ndirectly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in\npart a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain\nany mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\nthem.\n\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.  If a\nsection does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not\nallowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero\nInvariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant\nSections then there are none.\n\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed,\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may\nbe at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the\ngeneral public, that is suitable for revising the document\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\nfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\nto text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\nformat whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\nor discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\nAn image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount\nof text.  A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\nor XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\nHTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of\ntransparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats\ninclude proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by\nproprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or\nprocessing tools are not generally available, and the\nmachine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word\nprocessors for output purposes only.\n\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\nplus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\nthis License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\nformats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\npreceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\nThe \"publisher\" means any person or entity that distributes copies of\nthe Document to the public.\n\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose\ntitle either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\ntext that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\nspecific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\",\n\"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".)  To \"Preserve the Title\"\nof such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\nsection \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\n\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\nstates that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty\nDisclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this\nLicense, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\nimplication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has\nno effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no\nother conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\nyou may publicly display copies.\n\n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\nprinted covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\nDocument's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the\ncopies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\nthe back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\nyou as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\nthe full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\nvisible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\nthe title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\nas verbatim copying in other respects.\n\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\npages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\na computer-network location from which the general network-using\npublic has access to download using public-standard network protocols\na complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.\nIf you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,\nwhen you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure\nthat this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\nlocation until at least one year after the last time you distribute an\nOpaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that\nedition to the public.\n\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to\ngive them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the\nDocument.\n\n\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\nthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\nthe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\nVersion filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\nand modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\nof it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\n   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\n   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\n   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\n   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\n   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\n   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),\n   unless they release you from this requirement.\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\n   Modified Version, as the publisher.\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\n   adjacent to the other copyright notices.\nF. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\n   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\n   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\n   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\nI. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add\n   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\n   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\n   there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one\n   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\n   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\n   Version as stated in the previous sentence.\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\n   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\n   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\n   it was based on.  These may be placed in the \"History\" section.\n   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\n   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\n   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\nK. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\",\n   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all\n   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\n   and/or dedications given therein.\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\n   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\n   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\nM. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\".  Such a section\n   may not be included in the Modified Version.\nN. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\"\n   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\nappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\ncopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\nof these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\nlist of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\nThese titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\nnothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\nparties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\nbeen approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\nstandard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\npassage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\nof Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\nFront-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\nthrough arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\nincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\nby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\nyou may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\npermission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\ngive permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\nInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\nlicense notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by\nadding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\nauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\nMake the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\nInvariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\"\nin the various original documents, forming one section Entitled\n\"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\nand any sections Entitled \"Dedications\".  You must delete all sections\nEntitled \"Endorsements\".\n\n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other\ndocuments released under this License, and replace the individual\ncopies of this License in the various documents with a single copy\nthat is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules\nof this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all\nother respects.\n\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and\ndistribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a\ncopy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this\nLicense in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that\ndocument.\n\n\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\nand independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright\nresulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights\nof the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.\nWhen the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not\napply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\nderivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\nthe entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\ncovers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\nOtherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole\naggregate.\n\n\n8. TRANSLATION\n\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\ndistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\nReplacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\npermission from their copyright holders, but you may include\ntranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\noriginal versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\ntranslation of this License, and all the license notices in the\nDocument, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\nthe original English version of this License and the original versions\nof those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between\nthe translation and the original version of this License or a notice\nor disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\n\"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\nits Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual\ntitle.\n\n\n9. TERMINATION\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and\nwill automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\nfrom a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\nunless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\nterminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder\nfails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to\n60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does\nnot give you any rights to use it.\n\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the\nGNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\ndetail to address new problems or concerns.  See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\nIf the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this\nLicense \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that specified version or\nof any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\nFree Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\nas a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document\nspecifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this\nLicense can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a\nversion permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the\nDocument.\n\n11. RELICENSING\n\n\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any\nWorld Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also\nprovides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A\npublic wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A\n\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the site\nmeans any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\n\n\"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 \nlicense published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit \ncorporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, \nCalifornia, as well as future copyleft versions of that license \npublished by that same organization.\n\n\"Incorporate\" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in \npart, as part of another Document.\n\nAn MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this \nLicense, and if all works that were first published under this License \nsomewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or \nin part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and \n(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\n\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site\nunder CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,\nprovided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.\n\n\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\nthe License in the document and put the following copyright and\nlicense notices just after the title page:\n\n    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\n    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\n    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3\n    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\n    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\n    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU\n    Free Documentation License\".\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\nreplace the \"with...Texts.\" line with this:\n\n    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\n    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other\ncombination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the\nsituation.\n\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\nrecommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of\nfree software license, such as the GNU General Public License,\nto permit their use in free software.\n",
  "YPLv1.1": " Yahoo! Public License, Version 1.1 (YPL)\n\nThis Yahoo! Public License (this \"Agreement\") is a legal agreement\nthat describes the terms under which Yahoo! Inc., a Delaware\ncorporation having its principal place of business at 701 First\nAvenue, Sunnyvale, California 94089 (\"Yahoo!\") will provide software\nto you via download or otherwise (\"Software\"). By using the Software,\nyou, an individual or an entity (\"You\") agree to the terms of this\nAgreement.\n\nIn consideration of the mutual promises and upon the terms and\nconditions set forth below, the parties agree as follows:\n\n 1. Grant of Copyright License\n\n        1.1 - Subject  to the terms and conditions  of this Agreement,\n        Yahoo!  hereby  grants  to  You,  under any  and  all  of  its\n        copyright  interest in  and to  the Software,  a royalty-free,\n        non-exclusive,  non-transferable  license   to  copy,  modify,\n        compile,   execute,   and    distribute   the   Software   and\n        Modifications. For the purposes  of this Agreement, any change\n        to, addition to, or abridgement of the Software made by You is\n        a \"Modification;\"  however, any file  You add to  the Software\n        that  does not  contain  any part  of the  Software  is not  a\n        \"Modification.\"\n\n        1.2 - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a\n        corporation or other entity, Your use of the Software or any\n        Modification is subject to Your having the authority to bind\n        such corporation or entity to this Agreement. Providing copies\n        to persons within such corporation or entity is not considered\n        distribution for purposes of this Agreement.\n\n        1.3 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in\n        source code format, You must do so only under the terms of\n        this Agreement, and You must include a complete copy of this\n        Agreement with Your distribution. With respect to any\n        Modification You distribute in source code format, the terms\n        of this Agreement will apply to You in the same way those\n        terms apply to Yahoo! with respect to the Software. In other\n        words, when You are distributing Modifications under this\n        Agreement, You \"stand in the shoes\" of Yahoo! in terms of the\n        rights You grant and how the terms and conditions apply to You\n        and the licensees of Your Modifications. Notwithstanding the\n        foregoing, when You \"stand in the shoes\" of Yahoo!, You are\n        not subject to the jurisdiction provision under Section 7,\n        which requires all disputes under this Agreement to be subject\n        to the jurisdiction of federal or state courts of northern\n        California.\n\n        1.4 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in\n        compiled or object code format, You must also provide\n        recipients with access to the Software or Modification in\n        source code format along with a complete copy of this\n        Agreement. The distribution of the Software or Modifications\n        in compiled or object code format may be under a license of\n        Your choice, provided that You are in compliance with the\n        terms of this Agreement. In addition, You must make absolutely\n        clear that any license terms applying to such Software or\n        Modification that differ from this Agreement are offered by\n        You alone and not by Yahoo!, and that such license does not\n        restrict recipients from exercising rights in the source code\n        to the Software granted by Yahoo! under this Agreement or\n        rights in the source code to any Modification granted by You\n        as described in Section 1.3.\n\n        1.5 - This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute\n        files that are entirely Your own work (i.e., which do not\n        incorporate any portion of the Software and are not\n        Modifications) under any terms You choose.\n\n 2. Support\n\n        Yahoo! has no obligation to provide technical support or\n        updates to You. Nothing in this Agreement requires Yahoo! to\n        enter into any license with You for any other edition of the\n        Software.\n\n 3. Intellectual Property Rights\n\n        3.1 - Except for the license expressly granted under copyright\n        in Section 1.1, no rights, licenses or forbearances are\n        granted or may arise in relation to this Agreement whether\n        expressly, by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or\n        otherwise. All rights, including all intellectual property\n        rights, that are not expressly granted under this Agreement\n        are hereby reserved.\n\n        3.2 - In any copy of the Software or in any Modification you\n        create, You must retain and reproduce, any and all copyright,\n        patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are included\n        in the Software in the same form as they appear in the\n        Software. This includes the preservation of attribution\n        notices in the form of trademarks or logos that exist within a\n        user interface of the Software.\n\n        3.3 - This license does not grant You rights to use any\n        party's name, logo, or trademarks, except solely as necessary\n        to comply with Section 3.2.\n\n 4. Disclaimer of Warranties\n\n        THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n        KIND. YAHOO! MAKES NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR\n        STATUTORY REGARDING OR RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE. SPECIFICALLY,\n        YAHOO! DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE\n        OR WILL PERFORM IN AN UNINTERRUPTED MANNER. TO THE GREATEST\n        EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, YAHOO! SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL\n        IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A\n        PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF YAHOO! HAD BEEN INFORMED OF SUCH\n        PURPOSE), AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE,\n        ANY MODIFICATIONS THERETO AND WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE\n        FOREGOING.\n\n 5. Limitation of Liability\n\n        IN NO EVENT WILL YAHOO! BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\n        INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF\n        ANY KIND (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS\n        OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF COVER) IN\n        CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE\n        FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER\n        RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF\n        CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, AND EVEN\n        IF YAHOO! HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n 6. Term and Termination\n\n        6.1 - This Agreement will continue in effect unless and until\n        terminated earlier pursuant to this Section 6.\n\n        6.2 - In the event You violate the terms of this Agreement,\n        Yahoo! may terminate this Agreement.\n\n        6.3 - All licenses granted hereunder shall terminate upon the\n        termination of this Agreement. Termination will be in addition\n        to any rights and remedies available to Yahoo! at law or\n        equity or under this Agreement.\n\n        6.4 - Termination of this Agreement will not affect the\n        provisions regarding reservation of rights (Section 3.1),\n        provisions disclaiming or limiting Yahoo!'s liability\n        (Sections 4 and 5), Termination (Section 6) or Miscellaneous\n        (Section 7), which provisions will survive termination of this\n        Agreement.\n\n 7. Miscellaneous\n\n        This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties\n        with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and\n        supersedes all previous communications, representations,\n        understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between\n        the parties with respect to said subject matter. The\n        relationship of the parties hereunder is that of independent\n        contractors, and this Agreement will not be construed as\n        creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other\n        form of legal association between the parties. If any term,\n        condition, or provision in this Agreement is found to be\n        invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, this\n        Agreement will be construed in a manner that most closely\n        effectuates the intent of this Agreement. Such invalid term,\n        condition or provision will be severed from the remaining\n        terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue to be\n        valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by\n        law. This Agreement will be interpreted and construed in\n        accordance with the laws of the State of California and the\n        United States of America, without regard to conflict of law\n        principles. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the\n        International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this\n        Agreement. All disputes arising out of this Agreement\n        involving Yahoo! or any of its subsidiaries shall be subject\n        to the jurisdiction of the federal or state courts of northern\n        California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\n        California. No rights may be assigned, no obligations may be\n        delegated, and this Agreement may not be transferred by You,\n        in whole or in part, whether voluntary or by operation of law,\n        including by way of sale of assets, merger or consolidation,\n        without the prior written consent of Yahoo!, and any purported\n        assignment, delegation or transfer without such consent shall\n        be void ab initio. Any waiver of the provisions of this\n        Agreement or of a party's rights or remedies under this\n        Agreement must be in writing to be effective. Failure, neglect\n        or delay by a party to enforce the provisions of this\n        Agreement or its rights or remedies at any time, will not be\n        construed or be deemed to be a waiver of such party's rights\n        under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the\n        validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or\n        prejudice such party's right to take subsequent action.\n",
  "GFDLv1.1": " GNU Free Documentation License\n                   Version 1.1, March 2000\n\n Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\n0. PREAMBLE\n\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\nwritten document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone\nthe effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without\nmodifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,\nthis License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get\ncredit for their work, while not being considered responsible for\nmodifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative\nworks of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\nlicense designed for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License applies to any manual or other work that contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed\nunder the terms of this License.  The \"Document\", below, refers to any\nsuch manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is\naddressed as \"you\".\n\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\nmodifications and/or translated into another language.\n\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\nthe Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject\n(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\nwithin that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a\ntextbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\nmathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\nthem.\n\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.\n\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed,\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe Document is released under this License.\n\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the\ngeneral public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\nfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\nto text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\nformat whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage\nsubsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is\nnot \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\nor XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\nHTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include\nPostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only\nby proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or\nprocessing tools are not generally available, and the\nmachine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output\npurposes only.\n\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\nplus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\nthis License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\nformats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\npreceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\nconditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\nyou may publicly display copies.\n\n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\nIf you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,\nand the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose\nthe copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\nthe back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\nyou as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\nthe full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\nvisible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\nthe title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\nas verbatim copying in other respects.\n\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\npages.\n\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\na publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete\nTransparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the\ngeneral network-using public has access to download anonymously at no\ncharge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter\noption, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\ndistribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this\nTransparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location\nuntil at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque\ncopy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to\nthe public.\n\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\nthem a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n\n\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\nthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\nthe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\nVersion filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\nand modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\nof it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\n   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\n   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\n   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\n   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\n   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\n   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\n   Modified Version, as the publisher.\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\n   adjacent to the other copyright notices.\nF. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\n   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\n   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\n   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\nI. Preserve the section entitled \"History\", and its title, and add to\n   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\n   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\n   there is no section entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one\n   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\n   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\n   Version as stated in the previous sentence.\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\n   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\n   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\n   it was based on.  These may be placed in the \"History\" section.\n   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\n   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\n   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\nK. In any section entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\",\n   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the\n   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\n   and/or dedications given therein.\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\n   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\n   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\nM. Delete any section entitled \"Endorsements\".  Such a section\n   may not be included in the Modified Version.\nN. Do not retitle any existing section as \"Endorsements\"\n   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\n\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\nappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\ncopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\nof these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\nlist of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\nThese titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\nYou may add a section entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\nnothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\nparties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\nbeen approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\nstandard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\npassage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\nof Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\nFront-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\nthrough arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\nincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\nby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\nyou may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\npermission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\ngive permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\nInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\nlicense notice.\n\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by\nadding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\nauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\nMake the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\nInvariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections entitled \"History\"\nin the various original documents, forming one section entitled\n\"History\"; likewise combine any sections entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\nand any sections entitled \"Dedications\".  You must delete all sections\nentitled \"Endorsements.\"\n\n\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\nreleased under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\nLicense in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\nthe collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\nverbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\nit individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\nLicense into the extracted document, and follow this License in all\nother respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n\n\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\nand independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version\nof the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the\ncompilation.  Such a compilation is called an \"aggregate\", and this\nLicense does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled\nwith the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they\nare not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter\nof the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\ncovers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.\nOtherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.\n\n\n8. TRANSLATION\n\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\ndistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\nReplacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\npermission from their copyright holders, but you may include\ntranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\noriginal versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\ntranslation of this License provided that you also include the\noriginal English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement\nbetween the translation and the original English version of this\nLicense, the original English version will prevail.\n\n\n9. TERMINATION\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except\nas expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to\ncopy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License.
